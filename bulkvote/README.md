# Bulk Vote Wrapper Script

This is a wrapper script around [Martin's voting script](https://github.com/gitmachtl/scripts) to simplify generating **bulk votes** on **treasury withdrawal proposals**.

Place this script in the same directory as Martin's scripts, or ensure his scripts are accessible via your system's `$PATH`.

---

## üöÄ Usage

```bash
./bulkvote.sh <drep vkey file> <proposals json file> <optional rationale url>
```

### Arguments

* **`<drep vkey file>`**
  Your DRep verification key file. It **must end with `.drep.vkey`**; the extension might be omitted when calling the script.

* **`<proposals json file>`**
  A local JSON file containing treasury withdrawal proposals.

  > ‚úÖ A sample file with the current 39 proposals is included with this script. This was fetched with the following command:
  > ````
  > echo "[" > proposals.json; first=1; for ((page=0;;page++)); do echo "Fetching page $page..." >&2; resp=$(curl -s "https://be.gov.tools/proposal/list?page=$page&pageSize=10&type[]=TreasuryWithdrawals"); items=$(echo "$resp" | jq -c '.elements[]'); [ -z "$items" ] && break; while IFS= read -r item; do [ $first -eq 0 ] && echo "," >> proposals.json; echo "$item" >> proposals.json; first=0; done <<< "$items"; done; echo "]" >> proposals.json
  > ````

* **`<optional rationale url>`**
  A **hosted URL** pointing to a **rationale JSON file in UTF-8** format.

  > üìé This rationale will be used for **all** proposals.

### Example

```bash
./bulkvote.sh mykey.drep.vkey proposals.json https://example.org/rationale.json
```

> üî∏ After each vote, the script pauses and waits for you to press `ENTER`. This helps you follow the process without missing output.
> You can comment out this line in the script if you prefer automatic, uninterrupted voting.

## ‚ö° Performance Tip ‚Äì SPO Stake Distribution Caching

Fetching the **SPO DRep delegation** via Martin‚Äôs `24a_genVote.sh` can be slow on every run. To improve performance, you can cache the result for the current epoch.

### üîß Patch Instructions

In Martin‚Äôs script `24a_genVote.sh` (as of `Update-2025-10`), **replace lines 312‚Äì315**:

**Original:**

```bash
#Get new Pool Stake Distribution including default delgation, for quorum calculation later on - available with this command since cli 10.2.0.0
showProcessAnimation "Query Stakepool-Distribution Info: " &
poolStakeDistributionJSON=$(${cardanocli} ${cliEra} query spo-stake-distribution --all-spos 2> /dev/stdout)
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then stopProcessAnimation; echo -e "\e[35mERROR - ${poolStakeDistributionJSON}\e[0m\n"; exit 1; else stopProcessAnimation; fi;
```

**Replace with:**

```bash
#Get new Pool Stake Distribution including default delgation, for quorum calculation later on - available with this command since cli 10.2.0.0
spoStakeDistCacheFile="cache-spo-stake-distribution.${currentEpoch}.json"
if [ -f "${spoStakeDistCacheFile}" ]; then
	echo "Use Stakepool-Distribution Info from cached file ${spoStakeDistCacheFile}"
	poolStakeDistributionJSON=$(cat "${spoStakeDistCacheFile}")
else
	showProcessAnimation "Query Stakepool-Distribution Info: " &
	poolStakeDistributionJSON=$(${cardanocli} ${cliEra} query spo-stake-distribution --all-spos 2> /dev/stdout)
	if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
		stopProcessAnimation
		echo -e "\e[35mERROR - ${poolStakeDistributionJSON}\e[0m\n"
		exit 1
	else
		stopProcessAnimation
		echo "${poolStakeDistributionJSON}" > "${spoStakeDistCacheFile}"
	fi
fi
```

This will cache the distribution JSON for the **current epoch**.

> üìù You can delete the file manually to refresh it, or modify the script to expire the cache sooner if desired.
