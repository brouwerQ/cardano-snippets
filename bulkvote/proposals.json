The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nWe have Hydra as our native state of the art state channel solution, we have partnerchains as our native evolution of sidechains, Midgard aims to be our native evolution of rollups.\n\nThe UTxO system is a match made in heaven for rollups. It allows us to build true L2 rollups that inherit maximal security from Cardano. This cannot be replicated in account based systems. It's not a coincidence that Fuel, the first general purpose L2 to receive a decentralization rating of stage 2 (highest possible) is UTxO based.\n\nFraud proofs for global state systems like Arbitrum and Optimism are extremely difficult to implement and very expensive and complicated to conduct onchain (and require multiple parties); this is why to this date despite spending millions in R&D neither of those protocols has working fraud proofs, and they all rely on centralized permissioned sequencers and operators.\n\nOn the other-hand, fraud proofs on Cardano are extremely straightforward and require only a single party (no challenge-response proofs) due to the local state properties of the ledger.\n\nNot a single blockchain has managed to achieve true permissionless general purpose rollups. At the end of the day, the top \"L2s\"in the blockchain space right now are all custodial multisigs. The Midgard framework is a first of its kind, in its capabilities to deploy completely permissionless rollups that inherit the full security of Cardano.\n\n- No centralized sequencer\n\n- No challenge response \"proofs\"\n\n- No custodial multisig\n\n- Permissionless fraud proofs (open to anyone)\n\n- Permissionless operator set\n\n- Deposits and withdrawals cannot be censored (inherits the full censorship resistance of Cardano)\n\nThis is all made possible by Cardano's unique local state EUTxO architecture.\n\nUTxO contention, small block size, local state, transaction determinism, all of these \"problems\" may have led you to question why these design choices were made.\n\nMidgard aims to show you that these are actually not problems at all. In-fact quite the opposite, they are extremely powerful properties that, together, provide unique value that simply does not exist in any other ecosystem. These are, in actuality, the core pillars that make Midgard even possible in the first place.\n\nYou cannot build Midgard on Ethereum, Solana or Sui. It is a protocol that is only possible on Cardano.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nMidgard has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions on-chain but in a more compact form (ie. rolls up transactions offchain into a compact representation that is published on-chain, thus the name rollups). This means that increased economic activity on Midgard directly translated to increased economic activity on Cardano, this represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent consensus or economic security, instead it inherits economic security and consensus from Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAnastasia Labs is at the forefront of research & development on Cardano for over two years now. We have been involved in the development of nearly every large dApp on Cardano. We have made contributions to many of the core repos, and we actively maintain over 50 different open-source libraries, tools, and public infrastructure for Cardano.\n\nYou can read more about our work here:\n\n[https://www.anastasialabs.com/](https://www.anastasialabs.com/)\n\nFurthermore, Midgard is already in active development, and we have already made significant progress towards our goal of EOY mainnet readiness.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nWe have Hydra as our native state of the art state channel solution, we have partnerchains as our native evolution of sidechains, Midgard aims to be our native evolution of rollups.\n\nThe UTxO system is a match made in heaven for rollups. It allows us to build true L2 rollups that inherit maximal security from Cardano. This cannot be replicated in account based systems. It's not a coincidence that Fuel, the first general purpose L2 to receive a decentralization rating of stage 2 (highest possible) is UTxO based.\n\nFraud proofs for global state systems like Arbitrum and Optimism are extremely difficult to implement and very expensive and complicated to conduct onchain (and require multiple parties); this is why to this date despite spending millions in R&D neither of those protocols has working fraud proofs, and they all rely on centralized permissioned sequencers and operators.\n\nOn the other-hand, fraud proofs on Cardano are extremely straightforward and require only a single party (no challenge-response proofs) due to the local state properties of the ledger.\n\nNot a single blockchain has managed to achieve true permissionless general purpose rollups. At the end of the day, the top \"L2s\"in the blockchain space right now are all custodial multisigs. The Midgard framework is a first of its kind, in its capabilities to deploy completely permissionless rollups that inherit the full security of Cardano.\n\n- No centralized sequencer\n\n- No challenge response \"proofs\"\n\n- No custodial multisig\n\n- Permissionless fraud proofs (open to anyone)\n\n- Permissionless operator set\n\n- Deposits and withdrawals cannot be censored (inherits the full censorship resistance of Cardano)\n\nThis is all made possible by Cardano's unique local state EUTxO architecture.\n\nUTxO contention, small block size, local state, transaction determinism, all of these \"problems\" may have led you to question why these design choices were made.\n\nMidgard aims to show you that these are actually not problems at all. In-fact quite the opposite, they are extremely powerful properties that, together, provide unique value that simply does not exist in any other ecosystem. These are, in actuality, the core pillars that make Midgard even possible in the first place.\n\nYou cannot build Midgard on Ethereum, Solana or Sui. It is a protocol that is only possible on Cardano.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nMidgard has a tokenless design. All transaction fees on Midgard are paid in Ada, and every Midgard block is published to the Cardano L1. Where Hydra moves transactions offchain (and thus does not contribute consistently in fee revenue to the Cardano L1) Midgard keeps transactions on-chain but in a more compact form (ie. rolls up transactions offchain into a compact representation that is published on-chain, thus the name rollups). This means that increased economic activity on Midgard directly translated to increased economic activity on Cardano, this represents a significant source of fee revenue for the Cardano L1. Midgard does not have independent consensus or economic security, instead it inherits economic security and consensus from Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAnastasia Labs is at the forefront of research & development on Cardano for over two years now. We have been involved in the development of nearly every large dApp on Cardano. We have made contributions to many of the core repos, and we actively maintain over 50 different open-source libraries, tools, and public infrastructure for Cardano.\n\nYou can read more about our work here:\n\n[https://www.anastasialabs.com/](https://www.anastasialabs.com/)\n\nFurthermore, Midgard is already in active development, and we have already made significant progress towards our goal of EOY mainnet readiness.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

Consolidated item\n\nThis proposal addresses several critical challenges and opportunities within the Cardano ecosystem necessary for its continued growth, competitiveness, and decentralization. Key problems include:\n\n* **Scalability Limitations:** The current L1 infrastructure faces throughput constraints during high demand, hindering user experience and application potential. There's a need for significant scaling solutions at both Layer 1 (consensus) and Layer 2.\n\n* **Node Architecture & Performance:** The existing node design presents limitations in terms of modularity, extensibility, performance (especially RAM usage), and ease of contribution from diverse development teams.\n\n* **Smart Contract Assurance & Developer Experience:** Developers require enhanced tools for ensuring the security, correctness, and efficiency of smart contracts to build trust and reduce risks. Improving the Plinth/Aiken/Plutarch ecosystem and providing robust testing/verification tools is essential.\n\n* **SPO Viability & Security:** Ensuring the operational security of Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and investigating the fairness and sustainability of the incentive mechanism is vital for network health and decentralization.\n\n* **User Experience & Adoption Barriers:** Friction points like mandatory ADA fee payments and unpredictable transaction inclusion during congestion need addressing to improve usability and attract broader adoption.\n\n* **Ecosystem Competitiveness:** Cardano needs to integrate emerging blockchain paradigms like Actively Validated Services (AVS) to remain competitive and offer diverse functionalities.\n\n* **Core Maintenance & Knowledge Transfer:** The foundational codebase requires ongoing maintenance, modernization, technical debt reduction, and structured knowledge sharing to ensure stability and enable broader community participation in core development.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIn this proposal, IOE and its collaborators outline key core Cardano platform developments aimed at substantially improving network scalability, security, performance, and usability, while enhancing developer support.\n\nImplementation of these initiatives offers substantial benefits across the Cardano community, which collectively, enhance Cardano's technical foundations, enabling it to support a larger, more complex, and more active ecosystem:\n\n* **For the Ecosystem:** Delivers massive L1 throughput increase (Leios), robust L2 scaling (Hydra, Mithril), and positions Cardano competitively in new areas like AVS (Minotaur). Enhances overall network security, resilience, and decentralization. Fosters supplier diversity through knowledge sharing and modular architecture (Acropolis). The ROI stems from increased network capacity, utility, and attractiveness, driving adoption and value.\n\n* **For End Users:** Experience significantly reduced network congestion and faster transaction processing (Leios), near-instant finality for specific applications (Hydra), the convenience of paying fees with native tokens (Nested Transactions/Babel Fees), and potentially more predictable transaction inclusion (Tiered Pricing). Enhanced security measures build user trust.\n\n* **For Developers & dApp Builders:** Gain access to advanced tools for building more secure and efficient smart contracts (Plutus High Assurance suite, Plutus Core enhancements). Benefit from a more extensible and accessible node architecture (Acropolis), easier integration with L2s and light clients (Hydra, Mithril), and improved transaction capabilities (Nested Transactions). This lowers development barriers and enables more sophisticated applications.\n\n* **For Stake Pool Operators (SPOs):** Benefit from significantly reduced node operational costs (lower RAM requirements via Ledger-HD, LSM/UTXO-HD), enhanced operational security (KES Agent), improved network performance, potential new revenue streams (Minotaur AVS), and a potentially fairer incentive structure (Revised Scheme investigation). Mithril improvements speed up node synchronization.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nInput Output (IO) realized Cardano's vision for a secure, scalable, decentralized platform through a research-driven, phased delivery (Byron to Voltaire). Leveraging formal methods, functional programming, and rigorous engineering, IO produced key achievements including Proof-of-Stake, Ouroboros consensus, Plutus smart contracts, native tokens, and scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril.\n\nIOE and its partners' involvement spans the entire existence of Cardano, and is demonstrated daily by its active development, support, and maintenance.

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIn this proposal, IOE and its collaborators outline key core Cardano platform developments aimed at substantially improving network scalability, security, performance, and usability, while enhancing developer support.\n\nImplementation of these initiatives offers substantial benefits across the Cardano community, which collectively, enhance Cardano's technical foundations, enabling it to support a larger, more complex, and more active ecosystem:\n\n* **For the Ecosystem:** Delivers massive L1 throughput increase (Leios), robust L2 scaling (Hydra, Mithril), and positions Cardano competitively in new areas like AVS (Minotaur). Enhances overall network security, resilience, and decentralization. Fosters supplier diversity through knowledge sharing and modular architecture (Acropolis). The ROI stems from increased network capacity, utility, and attractiveness, driving adoption and value.\n\n* **For End Users:** Experience significantly reduced network congestion and faster transaction processing (Leios), near-instant finality for specific applications (Hydra), the convenience of paying fees with native tokens (Nested Transactions/Babel Fees), and potentially more predictable transaction inclusion (Tiered Pricing). Enhanced security measures build user trust.\n\n* **For Developers & dApp Builders:** Gain access to advanced tools for building more secure and efficient smart contracts (Plutus High Assurance suite, Plutus Core enhancements). Benefit from a more extensible and accessible node architecture (Acropolis), easier integration with L2s and light clients (Hydra, Mithril), and improved transaction capabilities (Nested Transactions). This lowers development barriers and enables more sophisticated applications.\n\n* **For Stake Pool Operators (SPOs):** Benefit from significantly reduced node operational costs (lower RAM requirements via Ledger-HD, LSM/UTXO-HD), enhanced operational security (KES Agent), improved network performance, potential new revenue streams (Minotaur AVS), and a potentially fairer incentive structure (Revised Scheme investigation). Mithril improvements speed up node synchronization.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nInput Output (IO) realized Cardano's vision for a secure, scalable, decentralized platform through a research-driven, phased delivery (Byron to Voltaire). Leveraging formal methods, functional programming, and rigorous engineering, IO produced key achievements including Proof-of-Stake, Ouroboros consensus, Plutus smart contracts, native tokens, and scaling solutions like Hydra and Mithril.\n\nIOE and its partners' involvement spans the entire existence of Cardano, and is demonstrated daily by its active development, support, and maintenance. Key personnel essential to this long-standing contribution are retained to continue this effort through 2025 and into 2026.\n\nIO remains committed to furthering Cardano's technical development, research and community engagement.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs.

The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe demand for a reliable infrastructure and tools that support development is what led to the creation of Blockfrost. If you have interacted with the Cardano Blockchain, there is a good chance you were interacting with Blockfrost in the background.\n\nBut this level of adoption has come with some trade-offs. At it's peak, Blockfrost was handling over 50% of all on-chain transactions on Cardano. We recognize this concentration is in contrast to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, and have actively been working to decentralize Blockfrost for the benefit of the Cardano community.\n\nTogether with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators, we have started the initial phase of what we call the Icebreakers era, an incentivized program designed to decentralize Cardano data access and reward the incredible node operator community.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n**The Icebreakers**\n\nThe Icebreakers is a decentralized network of endpoints that allow developers to access Cardano data through a set of reliable node operators, instead of relying on a single centralized source.\n\nBy joining the Icebreaker program, SPOs and other Cardano node operators can monetize their existing infrastructure by processing API requests as part of the Blockfrost network.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nTo ensure transparency and to prevent vendor lock-in, we are open-sourcing all components of the deliverables. This includes the infrastructure, libraries and documentation.\n\nOur primary focus is on two key projects: The Blockfrost Platform and the Blockfrost Gateway. Both are designed to expand the capabilities of the Icebreaker network.\n\n**Blockfrost Platform**\n\nThe Blockfrost platform is a next-generation backend designed to run on existing SPO relays, utilizing existing resources and rewarding operators with a share of Blockfrost's current revenue by serving our existing customers.\n\n**Blockfrost Gateway**\n\nThe Blockfrost gateway is the entry point for individual SPOs running the Blockfrost platform. Through the gateway, SPOs can receive requests from Blockfrost users. In return for processing these requests, they earn a share of the revenue.\n\nWith the Blockfrost Gateway, anyone can run their own Blockfrost instance with their own platform. We plan to use Hydra to open micro-payment channels between parties, enabling them to exchange ADA or other tokens for their services.\n\nWe are also developing the Solitary mode, which is designed for teams that require full ownership of their environment. Developers and enterprise customers can deploy a customized and independent Blockfrost instance with complete control of the infrastructure, uptime and security.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nBlockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node. Blockfrost aims to decentralize its Cardano Blockchain API through the Blockfrost Platform and Blockfrost Gateway, enabling a network of Icebreakers operated by SPOs and node operators to process API requests and share revenue. All components are open-sourced to ensure transparency and avoid vendor lock-in.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh.

If you have interacted with the Cardano Blockchain, there is a good chance you were interacting with Blockfrost in the background.\n\nBut this level of adoption has come with some trade-offs. At it's peak, Blockfrost was handling over 50% of all on-chain transactions on Cardano. We recognize this concentration is in contrast to the decentralized nature of the blockchain, and have actively been working to decentralize Blockfrost for the benefit of the Cardano community.\n\nTogether with Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) and node operators, we have started the initial phase of what we call the Icebreakers era, an incentivized program designed to decentralize Cardano data access and reward the incredible node operator community.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n**The Icebreakers**\n\nThe Icebreakers is a decentralized network of endpoints that allow developers to access Cardano data through a set of reliable node operators, instead of relying on a single centralized source.\n\nBy joining the Icebreaker program, SPOs and other Cardano node operators can monetize their existing infrastructure by processing API requests as part of the Blockfrost network.\n\n**Deliverables**\n\nTo ensure transparency and to prevent vendor lock-in, we are open-sourcing all components of the deliverables. This includes the infrastructure, libraries and documentation.\n\nOur primary focus is on two key projects: The Blockfrost Platform and the Blockfrost Gateway. Both are designed to expand the capabilities of the Icebreaker network.\n\n**Blockfrost Platform**\n\nThe Blockfrost platform is a next-generation backend designed to run on existing SPO relays, utilizing existing resources and rewarding operators with a share of Blockfrost's current revenue by serving our existing customers.\n\n**Blockfrost Gateway**\n\nThe Blockfrost gateway is the entry point for individual SPOs running the Blockfrost platform. Through the gateway, SPOs can receive requests from Blockfrost users. In return for processing these requests, they earn a share of the revenue.\n\nWith the Blockfrost Gateway, anyone can run their own Blockfrost instance with their own platform. We plan to use Hydra to open micro-payment channels between parties, enabling them to exchange ADA or other tokens for their services.\n\nWe are also developing the Solitary mode, which is designed for teams that require full ownership of their environment. Developers and enterprise customers can deploy a customized and independent Blockfrost instance with complete control of the infrastructure, uptime and security.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nBlockfrost is a powerful API platform that gives anyone access to the Cardano Blockchain and functionality without the need to run your own Node. Blockfrost aims to decentralize its Cardano Blockchain API through the Blockfrost Platform and Blockfrost Gateway, enabling a network of Icebreakers operated by SPOs and node operators to process API requests and share revenue. All components are open-sourced to ensure transparency and avoid vendor lock-in.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIf implementation of new Cardano features and breaking changes is not completed then hardware wallets may become incompatible with Cardano, stopping users from accessing newer blockchain features or stop working altogether.\n\nIf regular maintenance, bugfixing and developer support is not completed, wallets may lack functionalities and development of tooling that is using HW wallets may become impossible or much more difficult.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nVacuumlabs has been developing the Cardano HW wallets integrations (Ledger and Trezor) since 2018.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Pallas: Sustaining Critical Rust Tooling for Cardano** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis request for support focuses on Pallas (github.com/txpipe/pallas), a collection of Rust-native building blocks for the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. Pallas provides reusable components, such as cryptographic primitives and CBOR encoding, to enable the development of higher-level use cases like explorers and wallets. The project remains open-source, and actively welcomes contributions from the broader Cardano developer community. With 591 commits, over 430 pull requests, and 39 contributors, it stands as a strong example of open-source collaboration in the ecosystem. Pallas is being used by key projects in the ecosystem such as Aiken, Lucid, Mithril, Amaru, and many others. To ensure its continued evolution and maximize its impact, Pallas requires ongoing maintenance, updates, and new functionalities. We are requesting funding to secure the following roles assigned to the project: 0.5 FTE blockchain developer and 0.125 FTE tech lead.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nPallas has become a critical Rust-native foundation for Cardano development, providing essential blockchain primitives such as cryptographic primitives and CBOR encoding. However, maintaining an open-source project of this scale requires continuous effort---bug fixes, updates to support protocol changes, performance optimizations, and new feature development. Without dedicated resources, Pallas risks stagnation, which could impact the many projects and developers who rely on it. This proposal seeks funding to ensure Pallas remains well-maintained, up-to-date, and capable of evolving alongside the broader Cardano ecosystem.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSecuring ongoing funding for Pallas directly benefits the Cardano developer community by ensuring its continued reliability and performance as a key open-source resource for the Cardano ecosystem. Projects like Aiken, Lucid, Mithril, and Amaru already utilize Pallas to streamline development and reduce infrastructure complexity. By maintaining Pallas, we help developers focus on building applications rather than managing low-level blockchain details. This support strengthens the ecosystem's developer tooling, makes it easier for new developers to contribute, and fosters innovation across various Cardano-based projects.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH.

The project remains open-source, and actively welcomes contributions from the broader Cardano developer community.

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSecuring ongoing funding for Pallas directly benefits the Cardano developer community by ensuring its continued reliability and performance as a key open-source resource for the Cardano ecosystem. Projects like Aiken, Lucid, Mithril, and Amaru already utilize Pallas to streamline development and reduce infrastructure complexity. By maintaining Pallas, we help developers focus on building applications rather than managing low-level blockchain details. This support strengthens the ecosystem's developer tooling, makes it easier for new developers to contribute, and fosters innovation across various Cardano-based projects.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds zkFold ZK Rollup which will provide the following services:\n\nZK rollups address the scalability problem. Hundreds of transactions can be submitted as a single batch, reducing the load on the L1. Cardano can achieve higher throughput and lower transaction costs.\n\nzkFold offers to build a general-purpose zero knowledge rollup solution for Cardano. A zero knowledge rollup is a technological layer (Layer 2) on top of a blockchain that increases the blockchain's scalability potential by compressing many transactions into transaction batches. As batches offer a greater degree of information compression, it is reasonable to expect that hundreds of rollup smart contract transactions might fit into a single Cardano mainnet transaction. Zero knowledge proofs technology places a limit on the cost of on-chain verification of the validity of transaction batches. Specifically, the batch verification fits well within the Execution Unit limits set at the protocol level, as demonstrated by the prototype created by the zkFold team.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nScalability is a challenge for Cardano. As it grows, more dApps and users join, the demand for processing capacity increases, leading to congestion, slower transaction times, and higher fees.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nzkFold will develop and implement ZK rollups on Cardano to scale it efficiently, promoting broader adoption and supporting an ecosystem of decentralized applications and services.\n\nOverall, the proposal will have the following positive impact on the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n- Improved Scalability: ZK rollups enable Cardano to process significantly more transactions per second (TPS) by bundling and verifying transactions off-chain. This reduces congestion, benefiting users by ensuring faster and more efficient dApp interactions.\n\n- Lower Transaction Costs: By reducing the number of transactions directly processed on-chain, ZK rollups lower the transaction fees, making Cardano more accessible and affordable, especially for smaller transactions or micro-payments.\n\n- Enhanced User Experience: Lower fees create a smoother experience for users interacting with dApps, decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, and NFT marketplaces.\n\n- Increased Adoption: ZK rollups can make the Cardano ecosystem more attractive for developers and users, promoting the growth of dApps, DeFi, and other blockchain applications by offering higher performance and scalability.\n\n- Maintained Security: ZK rollups allow for scalability improvements without compromising the security and decentralization of the Cardano base layer, as Cardano still plays the role of the settlement layer for the rollup transactions.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nzkFold team has successfully moving towards the TestNet of our ZK Rollup. The zkFold team consists of expert Haskell, Rust, and ZKP developers and Cryptographers.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

To continue improving its efficiency, maintaining compatibility with Cardano upgrades, and expanding its capabilities, ongoing development and maintenance are necessary. This proposal seeks funding to ensure Dolos remains actively supported, optimized, and available for the growing number of projects relying on it.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSecuring funding for Dolos will ensure its continued maintenance, optimization, and feature expansion, directly benefiting projects that rely on fast and lightweight access to Cardano ledger data. Continued improvements will enhance performance, reduce infrastructure overhead, and support a broader range of use cases. By keeping Dolos actively maintained, the Cardano developer community gains a robust and efficient alternative to traditional node setups, lowering operational costs and improving blockchain data accessibility.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nTxPipe is an active member of the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has been developing open-source tools for the Cardano ecosystem for over 3 years and we're not going anywhere. Evidence of our commitment can be found by evaluating the continuous activity of our public code repositories.\n\nExperience developing in the Cardano ecosystem\n\nTxPipe has helped developed several dApps for the Cardano ecosystem. This experience allows us to evaluate the feasibility of the project and its potential benefit from a developer's perspective. We've also participated in development of chains using the released version of the IOG's Partnerchain SDK.\n\nSuccessful Catalyst proposals\n\nWe have successfully completed several Catalyst proposals. This may serve as evidence that our team has the required capabilities to fulfill these type of projects.\n\nDevelopment process will be public and open-source\n\nBoth the output and the development process will be public and open-source. This approach provides an easy way for the Catalyst team and the Cardano community to evaluate the progress at each step of the process.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nLedger wallet users will have better Cardano experience. Further app updates and releases will be faster and cheaper due to Ledger testing suite compatibility.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nVacuumlabs is a technology company founded in 2013, specializing in fintech product engineering, including blockchain solutions. Within the Cardano ecosystem, they are a significant contributor, known for co-developing the AdaLite and Yoroi wallets, and contributing to Ledger and Trezor hardware wallet support for Cardano. They also incubated and launched WingRiders, a decentralized exchange (DEX) that became a leading platform on Cardano. Furthermore, Vacuumlabs actively engages in smart contract auditing and provides blockchain consulting services for fintech companies looking to integrate with Cardano.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Leveraging Maestro's enterprise-grade UTXO infrastructure platform, this integration will bridge Bitcoin's substantial liquidity and large user base directly into the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nMaestro's solution will provide a complete suite of developer-friendly infrastructure services and tools, including:\n\nBlockchain Indexer: For real-time blockchain data querying and insights.\n\n- Blockchain Indexer: For real-time blockchain data querying and insights.\n\n- Mempool Monitoring: Enabling developers to detect transactions and on-chain events instantly, even before they are confirmed.\n\n- Event Notification System: Allowing instant webhook alerts for on-chain activities, significantly enhancing the responsiveness of dApps.\n\n- Wallet Manager: Facilitating secure, efficient wallet management, address derivation, and user transaction tracking.\n\nThese tools significantly improve the developer experience, dramatically reducing complexity and integration overhead. By abstracting away blockchain complexities, Maestro empowers developers to quickly build and deploy advanced DeFi applications, wallets, and Layer-2 integrations, directly utilizing Bitcoin liquidity.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nMaestro will help make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin faces inherent limitations in supporting DeFi and advanced smart contracts due to its minimal scripting capabilities and simpler UTXO model. Meanwhile, Cardano, despite being a highly capable smart contract platform leveraging an extended UTXO (EUTXO) model, struggles with attracting Bitcoin's substantial liquidity and integrating directly with Bitcoin's massive economic ecosystem. Without seamless interoperability, both blockchains remain limited: Bitcoin as a largely static asset store and Cardano without access to Bitcoin's immense capital pool and user base. Maestro seeks to address this by bridging the two ecosystems---leveraging Cardano's superior smart contract capabilities to unleash Bitcoin's latent liquidity, thus creating a robust decentralized financial layer powered by Bitcoin's underlying asset security.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIntegrating Maestro's infrastructure to enable Cardano as the smart contract layer for Bitcoin would generate substantial benefits across several layers of the Cardano developer ecosystem:\n\n1. Cardano DeFi Developers:\n\nDevelopers of DeFi applications (such as lending protocols like Fluidtokens) will gain immediate access to Bitcoin's immense liquidity pool, significantly expanding their potential user base and TVL. Maestro's integration enables developers to tap directly into Bitcoin's economic activity, dramatically increasing capital efficiency and profitability. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Significant growth in TVL, user engagement, and protocol revenues.\n\n- Easier user onboarding from Bitcoin-native communities.\n\n2. Wallet Developers (Tokeo, Begin, Lace, etc.):\n\nWallet applications will benefit from vastly expanded user functionality. By supporting direct Bitcoin-to-Cardano interactions, wallets can offer their users advanced features like Bitcoin-backed lending, staking, governance, and seamless cross-chain payments. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Increased wallet adoption and user retention.\n\n- Expanded revenue streams through cross-chain transaction fees and premium DeFi services.\n\n3. Layer 2 Solutions and Protocols (Midgard, Sundial, zkFold, BitcoinOS, Midnight):\n\nCardano's Layer 2 ecosystems will benefit by directly integrating with Bitcoin's user base. L2 solutions gain additional utility and liquidity, allowing their technologies (privacy layers, zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains) to achieve broader adoption and market validation. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Accelerated adoption and developer traction for L2 solutions.\n\n- Enabling innovative financial products and privacy-oriented services previously unavailable to Bitcoin holders.\n\n4. Cardano Ecosystem Overall:\n\nThe direct Bitcoin integration positions Cardano uniquely in the broader blockchain landscape. It would transform Cardano into the default execution and innovation layer for Bitcoin DeFi, attracting both institutional and retail adoption. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Enhanced market positioning as the leading decentralized finance ecosystem linked to Bitcoin.\n\n- Substantial increase in ecosystem visibility, credibility, and investment inflows.\n\nUltimately, the proposed integration presents Cardano with an opportunity to become the primary hub for Bitcoin's smart contract innovation and DeFi, unlocking extensive economic value, developer growth, and cross-chain collaboration.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMaestro has a proven track record of delivering high-performance infrastructure and developer tooling for UTXO-based blockchains, including extensive experience within the Cardano ecosystem. Maestro's platform already supports various high-profile Cardano projects and integrations, successfully handling millions of transactions and servicing numerous applications across DeFi, wallets, analytics, and Layer-2 scaling solutions. The Maestro team comprises seasoned blockchain engineers and industry experts with deep technical expertise in indexing, transaction management, and API development, demonstrating a commitment to high reliability, security, and scalability in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions.\n\nMaestro already supports numerous Cardano projects expanding into Bitcoin (e.g., Fluidtokens lending protocol, Tokeo Wallet, Begin Wallet, Lace Wallet) and Cardano L2s like Midgard, Sundial, zkFold, and BitcoinOS. Recent support for Midnight further expands these possibilities, enabling private DeFi transactions anchored by Bitcoin's economic security.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nMaestro will help make Cardano the smart contract layer for Bitcoin.\n\nCurrently, Bitcoin faces inherent limitations in supporting DeFi and advanced smart contracts due to its minimal scripting capabilities and simpler UTXO model. Meanwhile, Cardano, despite being a highly capable smart contract platform leveraging an extended UTXO (EUTXO) model, struggles with attracting Bitcoin's substantial liquidity and integrating directly with Bitcoin's massive economic ecosystem. Without seamless interoperability, both blockchains remain limited: Bitcoin as a largely static asset store and Cardano without access to Bitcoin's immense capital pool and user base. Maestro seeks to address this by bridging the two ecosystems---leveraging Cardano's superior smart contract capabilities to unleash Bitcoin's latent liquidity, thus creating a robust decentralized financial layer powered by Bitcoin's underlying asset security.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIntegrating Maestro's infrastructure to enable Cardano as the smart contract layer for Bitcoin would generate substantial benefits across several layers of the Cardano developer ecosystem:\n\n1. Cardano DeFi Developers:\n\nDevelopers of DeFi applications (such as lending protocols like Fluidtokens) will gain immediate access to Bitcoin's immense liquidity pool, significantly expanding their potential user base and TVL. Maestro's integration enables developers to tap directly into Bitcoin's economic activity, dramatically increasing capital efficiency and profitability. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Significant growth in TVL, user engagement, and protocol revenues.\n\n- Easier user onboarding from Bitcoin-native communities.\n\n2. Wallet Developers (Tokeo, Begin, Lace, etc.):\n\nWallet applications will benefit from vastly expanded user functionality. By supporting direct Bitcoin-to-Cardano interactions, wallets can offer their users advanced features like Bitcoin-backed lending, staking, governance, and seamless cross-chain payments. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Increased wallet adoption and user retention.\n\n- Expanded revenue streams through cross-chain transaction fees and premium DeFi services.\n\n3. Layer 2 Solutions and Protocols (Midgard, Sundial, zkFold, BitcoinOS, Midnight):\n\nCardano's Layer 2 ecosystems will benefit by directly integrating with Bitcoin's user base. L2 solutions gain additional utility and liquidity, allowing their technologies (privacy layers, zero-knowledge rollups, sidechains) to achieve broader adoption and market validation. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Accelerated adoption and developer traction for L2 solutions.\n\n- Enabling innovative financial products and privacy-oriented services previously unavailable to Bitcoin holders.\n\n4. Cardano Ecosystem Overall:\n\nThe direct Bitcoin integration positions Cardano uniquely in the broader blockchain landscape. It would transform Cardano into the default execution and innovation layer for Bitcoin DeFi, attracting both institutional and retail adoption. Demonstrated value includes:\n\n- Enhanced market positioning as the leading decentralized finance ecosystem linked to Bitcoin.\n\n- Substantial increase in ecosystem visibility, credibility, and investment inflows.\n\nUltimately, the proposed integration presents Cardano with an opportunity to become the primary hub for Bitcoin's smart contract innovation and DeFi, unlocking extensive economic value, developer growth, and cross-chain collaboration.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMaestro has a proven track record of delivering high-performance infrastructure and developer tooling for UTXO-based blockchains, including extensive experience within the Cardano ecosystem. Maestro's platform already supports various high-profile Cardano projects and integrations, successfully handling millions of transactions and servicing numerous applications across DeFi, wallets, analytics, and Layer-2 scaling solutions. The Maestro team comprises seasoned blockchain engineers and industry experts with deep technical expertise in indexing, transaction management, and API development, demonstrating a commitment to high reliability, security, and scalability in enterprise-grade blockchain solutions.\n\nMaestro already supports numerous Cardano projects expanding into Bitcoin (e.g., Fluidtokens lending protocol, Tokeo Wallet, Begin Wallet, Lace Wallet) and Cardano L2s like Midgard, Sundial, zkFold, and BitcoinOS. Recent support for Midnight further expands these possibilities, enabling private DeFi transactions anchored by Bitcoin's economic security.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem: Cardano's open-source ecosystem is critical to the network's long-term success, yet it lacks structured funding to support its growth. Unlike other blockchain ecosystems that provide clear financial backing for maintainers, contributors, and security efforts, Cardano's open-source projects often rely on ad-hoc funding or volunteer efforts.\n\nThis has led to several challenges:\n\n- Unmaintained Core Infrastructure: Key open-source repositories, including those used by dApp developers and the broader ecosystem, lack dedicated funding for long-term maintenance.\n\n- Loss of Contributors: Without clear incentives, experienced developers leave for other ecosystems, making it harder to sustain projects and onboard new talent.\n\n- Security Risks: A lack of structured funding for bug bounties and incident response leaves Cardano exposed to vulnerabilities that could otherwise be proactively addressed.\n\n- Slower Ecosystem Growth: The absence of stable funding for new tools, developer education, and strategic project support makes it difficult to keep pace with industry advancements.\n\n*Why This Matters*\n\nIf Cardano wants to remain a competitive, developer-friendly blockchain, it must invest in the sustainability of its open-source infrastructure. Without structured funding, key projects will stagnate, developer engagement will decline, and security risks will increase.\n\nA well-supported open-source ecosystem ensures:\n\n- Reliable infrastructure for wallets, dApps, and developer tooling.\n\n- More engaged developers who have clear pathways to contribute and earn.\n\n- Stronger security with funding for bug bounties and incident response.\n\n- A faster-growing ecosystem where teams can build with confidence, knowing key tools and services are actively maintained.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n*The Solution: The Paid Open Source Model*\n\nThis budget proposal introduces a Paid Open Source Model to ensure that essential open-source projects receive structured funding. It includes:\n\n- A Maintainer Retainer Program to fund developers maintaining critical repositories.\n\n- Bug bounty and security initiatives to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n\n- Developer advocacy and engagement programs to onboard and retain contributors.\n\n- An incubation framework to support promising open-source projects and help them scale.\n\nBy implementing this model, Cardano will create a predictable, transparent, and sustainable funding mechanism that supports long-term open-source development, improves security, and accelerates ecosystem growth.\n\n*Key Objectives & Strategic Impact*\n\n- Sustainable Open-Source Development: Funding for 50+ key projects via the Maintainer Retainer Program ensures continuous innovation and maintenance of mission-critical repositories.\n\n- Developer Onboarding & Retention: Programs like Cardano Summer of Code, Code For Us, and Developer Advocates provide clear pathways for new and experienced contributors to engage in Cardano development.\n\n- Security & Infrastructure Reliability: Investments in Bug Bounties, Incident Monitoring, and Tooling Sustainability safeguard the network and strengthen ecosystem resilience.\n\n- Commercialization & Ecosystem Growth: The Accelerator Research Program and Expanded Project Support Services transition promising projects from incubation to sustainable businesses.\n\n- Community Engagement & Governance: The OSC ensures transparent fund allocation, performance monitoring, and open participation for contributors across Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA.

The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem: Cardano's open-source ecosystem is critical to the network's long-term success, yet it lacks structured funding to support its growth. Unlike other blockchain ecosystems that provide clear financial backing for maintainers, contributors, and security efforts, Cardano's open-source projects often rely on ad-hoc funding or volunteer efforts.\n\nThis has led to several challenges:\n\n- Unmaintained Core Infrastructure: Key open-source repositories, including those used by dApp developers and the broader ecosystem, lack dedicated funding for long-term maintenance.\n\n- Loss of Contributors: Without clear incentives, experienced developers leave for other ecosystems, making it harder to sustain projects and onboard new talent.\n\n- Security Risks: A lack of structured funding for bug bounties and incident response leaves Cardano exposed to vulnerabilities that could otherwise be proactively addressed.\n\n- Slower Ecosystem Growth: The absence of stable funding for new tools, developer education, and strategic project support makes it difficult to keep pace with industry advancements.\n\n*Why This Matters*\n\nIf Cardano wants to remain a competitive, developer-friendly blockchain, it must invest in the sustainability of its open-source infrastructure. Without structured funding, key projects will stagnate, developer engagement will decline, and security risks will increase.\n\nA well-supported open-source ecosystem ensures:\n\n- Reliable infrastructure for wallets, dApps, and developer tooling.\n\n- More engaged developers who have clear pathways to contribute and earn.\n\n- Stronger security with funding for bug bounties and incident response.\n\n- A faster-growing ecosystem where teams can build with confidence, knowing key tools and services are actively maintained.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n*The Solution: The Paid Open Source Model*\n\nThis budget proposal introduces a Paid Open Source Model to ensure that essential open-source projects receive structured funding. It includes:\n\n- A Maintainer Retainer Program to fund developers maintaining critical repositories.\n\n- Bug bounty and security initiatives to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\n\n- Developer advocacy and engagement programs to onboard and retain contributors.\n\n- An incubation framework to support promising open-source projects and help them scale.\n\nBy implementing this model, Cardano will create a predictable, transparent, and sustainable funding mechanism that supports long-term open-source development, improves security, and accelerates ecosystem growth.\n\n*Key Objectives & Strategic Impact*\n\n- Sustainable Open-Source Development: Funding for 50+ key projects via the Maintainer Retainer Program ensures continuous innovation and maintenance of mission-critical repositories.\n\n- Developer Onboarding & Retention: Programs like Cardano Summer of Code, Code For Us, and Developer Advocates provide clear pathways for new and experienced contributors to engage in Cardano development.\n\n- Security & Infrastructure Reliability: Investments in Bug Bounties, Incident Monitoring, and Tooling Sustainability safeguard the network and strengthen ecosystem resilience.\n\n- Commercialization & Ecosystem Growth: The Accelerator Research Program and Expanded Project Support Services transition promising projects from incubation to sustainable businesses.\n\n- Community Engagement & Governance: The OSC ensures transparent fund allocation, performance monitoring, and open participation for contributors across Cardano.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nThis proposal will be facilitated and coordinated by Intersect, with the Open Source Committee and our dedicated Open Source Program Office supporting the execution.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures. Members of the elected Open Source Committee will provide the necessary checks and assurance on milestone acceptance.\n\nProject progress will also be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Without dedicated funding, this essential tool risks becoming outdated, hindering developer productivity.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThis proposal ensures Plutarch remains robust, up-to-date, and supported, benefiting Cardano developers and dApp projects who rely on it. The value is a more stable, efficient development environment, fostering innovation. The ROI includes increased developer productivity, enhanced dApp quality, and overall ecosystem health through maintained core infrastructure. Plutarch's wide adoption demonstrates its value.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMLabs LTD is the primary developer and maintainer of Cardano.nix. Our team possesses deep expertise in Nix, Cardano infrastructure deployment, and maintaining complex build systems, evidenced by the successful delivery and maintenance of Cardano.nix and its use by key ecosystem entities.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs.

		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nA suite of core infrastructure projects aimed at advancing the technical foundations of the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives focus on novel, high-impact developments across key areas of the Cardano stack. In the months ahead, Tweag intends to collaborate closely with qualified suppliers, DReps, and Intersect to further shape the structure and scope of these engagements.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAt Tweag by Modus Create, we offer a unique combination of deep technical expertise and strategic consulting capabilities, with a long-standing commitment to open-source and decentralized systems. EURL Tweag has been in business for over a decade, having started in 2013, and has built a reputation for engineering excellence across critical infrastructure projects.\n\nSince January 2018, we have been continuously engaged with IOG (Input Output Global) on a variety of initiatives within the Cardano ecosystem, including conducting audits and core protocol development. Since May 2021, we have also provided formal audits for the Cardano ecosystem, helping to ensure the reliability and security of mission-critical code.\n\nOur team has played a leading role in the development of Cardano's core infrastructure, including leading the consensus and ledger teams, implementing the Ouroboros Genesis protocol, and contributing to the design of Ouroboros Peras. We have been involved in nearly all aspects of the core Cardano node, giving us a comprehensive understanding of the system's architecture, roadmap, and strategic direction.\n\nBeyond Cardano, we bring deep, practical experience with Haskell, Rust, and a wide range of technologies used in polyglot projects, enabling us to engineer scalable, secure, and high-performance systems across domains.\n\nAs part of Modus Create, a global digital transformation consulting firm, we are backed by a diverse team of strategists, designers, and technologists who help the world's leading brands build digital advantage. Modus Create specializes in strategic consulting, full lifecycle product development, platform modernization, and digital operations and is an official partner of top-tier technology providers such as Atlassian, AWS, and GitHub. This global reach and cross-disciplinary strength provide our clients with unmatched capabilities throughout the full product development lifecycle.\n\nThis proposal reflects our ongoing commitment to advancing Cardano's mission through rigorous engineering, strategic alignment, and high-impact delivery.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **ZK Bridge** which will provide the following services:\n\nOur proposal is building a ZK bridge for Cardano, which we will deploy on the Cardano testnet.\n\nAs part of this initiative, we will define a communication protocol for the bridge, provide the full source code of the smart contracts on the Cardano side, and produce comprehensive technical documentation detailing the protocol between Cardano and any other isomorphic blockchain.\n\nWe will provide a circuit that enables a relayer to generate the ZK proof that a locking transaction was successfully added to the chain, which can then be verified on the receiving blockchain. This way, any blockchain will be able to implement a ZK bridge with Cardano, leveraging its newly added capability to generate such proofs.

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCross-chain interoperability remains one of the most critical yet unresolved challenges for Cardano. While the ecosystem is advancing in scalability through projects like Hydra and optimistic roll ups such as Midgard it still lacks a secure, trustless, and modular zk-based bridge infrastructure.\n\nCurrent bridges rely on centralized validators or multi-signature schemes, introducing major security risks---as demonstrated by numerous high-profile exploits in other ecosystems. Without a native zero-knowledge bridge, Cardano is unable to safely connect with external chains, severely limiting access to external liquidity, composability with other ecosystems, and the ability to scale horizontally.\n\nFurthermore, the Cardano ecosystem lacks a unified open-source toolkit for:\n\nOn-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs\n\nSecure and efficient cross-chain messaging\n\nAsset wrapping and unwrapping under Cardano's native token model\n\nAnd trust-minimized interoperability with existing ZK-rollups.\n\nThis absence puts Cardano at a competitive disadvantage compared to platforms like Ethereum, which already benefit from multiple zk-based Layer 2 solutions and zk-enabled bridges.\n\nA modular zkBridge is not only critical to unlock interoperability---it also lays the groundwork for a future Cardano-native zkRollup framework, by enabling the testing and deployment of foundational components such as provers, verifiers, and state synchronization mechanisms.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nBuilding a zero-knowledge bridge provides several key benefits to the Cardano ecosystem. A bridge between Cardano and other blockchains would make it much easier for value to flow in from external ecosystems, increasing the liquidity available within Cardano.\n\nA zero-knowledge bridge, specifically, offers important advantages over alternative architectures such as optimistic bridges. In a ZK bridge, a single user action accompanied by a succinct proof of deposit is sufficient to release tokens on the destination blockchain. This eliminates the need for community-wide monitoring or challenge periods, significantly reducing latency and trust assumptions.\n\nAdditionally, by building a ZK bridge, Cardano positions itself as a more interoperable platform, capable of engaging with the broader ecosystem of zero-knowledge technologies. This lays the groundwork for future innovations in identity, privacy-preserving applications, and cross-chain collaboration.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nEryx is a worker-owned labor cooperative with almost 15 years of experience solving complex problems involving mathematics and software. We are a group of nerdy PhDs with a solid background in math and computer science. Our team has extensive experience in blockchain development, cryptography, and privacy-focused protocols, which gives us the expertise required to successfully deliver the project.\n\nAmong other things, we've been core contributors to the Lambdaworks library and implemented the CircleSTARKS protocol in GPU alongside with Nethermind. This involved implementing several ZK cryptographic primitives (field operations, polynomial commitment schemes, FRI protocols, FFTs), in different platforms and languages. Furthermore, we implemented a proving system based on the Plonk protocol. During this project we wrote a simple interface to design circuits. It included basic operations and conditionals that made the building blocks for more complex cryptographic primitives. We also developed a Plonky2 backend for Aztec's Noir, funded by the Ethereum Foundation.\n\nIn relation to this proposal, we have extensive experience in Aiken smart contract development, including previously funded proposals under Project Catalyst focused on educational and technical infrastructure for Cardano. We also wrote zk circuits for cryptographic primitives such as hash functions and elliptic curve operations.\n\nWe are active contributors to the ENCOINS protocol, currently deployed on the Cardano mainnet with privacy-preserving features. Currently, we are researching the integration of ZK systems with the EUTxO model.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBuilding DApps on Cardano remains harder than it should be. New developers need to invest a substantial amount of time to become productive. It makes Cardano less attractive to build on, and limits the ability to innovate and produce value to end users.\n\nNew developers face multiple obstacles:\n\n1. Steep technical learning curve\n\n2. Fragmented technology stack (on-chain/off-chain, front-end/back-end)\n\n3. Limited development tooling and standard libraries\n\n4. Scattered educational resources\n\nIn anticipation of the wider adoption of Cardano technology by traditional organisations (e.g., in finance and fintech, where Java and Scala are dominant), it should be simpler for their web2 developers to start building on Cardano. Companies need a smooth path for their existing teams --- without the need to learn new programming languages or hire specialists just to get started.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n(1) Benefits for professionals\n\nScalus meets developers where they are. It bridges Web2 engineers from traditional firms with progressive onboarding and built-in safety, while giving seasoned Cardano builders advanced control and optimisations.\n\nWeb 2 developers:\n\n- Familiar dev experience & tooling using Scala\n\n- Elegant syntax with gentle learning curve of blockchain specifics\n\n- Built-in safety controls to reduce common mistakes and risks\n\nCardano builders / R&D Labs:\n\n- Low-level optimisations (memory, cost, advanced patterns)\n\n- Expressiveness beyond limited DSL\n\n- Advanced features (macros, meta-programming)\n\n- Rich Scala ecosystem for complex protocols and mission-critical solutions\n\n(2) Benefits for businesses\n\nScalus, paired with Scala 3, helps businesses build on Cardano without the usual headaches. It's a practical way to deliver value quickly and reliably.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Productivity boost at scale with Scala 3\n\n- Reduced time-to-market - from prototyping to production in less time\n\n- Deep pool of Scala/Java/Kotlin talent available on the market\n\n- Code quality and safety are first-class citizens\n\n- Reduced training investments to transition Scala/Java/Kotlin teams to blockchain\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOleksandr Nemish is a seasoned software engineer with a specialised focus on functional programming, type theory, meta-programming, compilers, and blockchains. His expertise is underscored by his proficiency in languages such as Scala, Haskell and Rust.\n\nOleksandr has a robust professional background, having worked for prominent financial organisations like Deutsche Bank and UBS.\n\nOleksandr Nemish is a former engineer at IOG, the engineering company behind the Cardano blockchain. He worked on the design and implementation of Marlowe -- a new financial smart contracts programming language for Cardano.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs.

				"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Scalus - DApps Development Platform** which will provide the following services:\n\nDeveloping DApps on Cardano shouldn't require juggling multiple languages, libraries and frameworks.\n\nScalus changes this by bringing the power of Scala 3 to the Cardano ecosystem, letting you write smart contracts, build transactions, and application layers --- all with the same language and familiar tools.\n\nIt supports the complete development flow - setup, development, testing, debugging and deployment, backed by an industry-grade toolset and professional development experience.\n\nKey benefits that make Scalus + Scala 3 stand out:\n\n- Productivity boost at scale with Scala 3\n\n- Reduced time-to-market - from prototyping to production in less time\n\n- Deep pool of Scala/Java/Kotlin talent available on the market\n\nScalus is a Cardano DApps development platform made for professionals and businesses who want to get things done.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBuilding DApps on Cardano remains harder than it should be. New developers need to invest a substantial amount of time to become productive. It makes Cardano less attractive to build on, and limits the ability to innovate and produce value to end users.\n\nNew developers face multiple obstacles:\n\n1. Steep technical learning curve\n\n2. Fragmented technology stack (on-chain/off-chain, front-end/back-end)\n\n3. Limited development tooling and standard libraries\n\n4. Scattered educational resources\n\nIn anticipation of the wider adoption of Cardano technology by traditional organisations (e.g., in finance and fintech, where Java and Scala are dominant), it should be simpler for their web2 developers to start building on Cardano. Companies need a smooth path for their existing teams --- without the need to learn new programming languages or hire specialists just to get started.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n(1) Benefits for professionals\n\nScalus meets developers where they are. It bridges Web2 engineers from traditional firms with progressive onboarding and built-in safety, while giving seasoned Cardano builders advanced control and optimisations.\n\nWeb 2 developers:\n\n- Familiar dev experience & tooling using Scala\n\n- Elegant syntax with gentle learning curve of blockchain specifics\n\n- Built-in safety controls to reduce common mistakes and risks\n\nCardano builders / R&D Labs:\n\n- Low-level optimisations (memory, cost, advanced patterns)\n\n- Expressiveness beyond limited DSL\n\n- Advanced features (macros, meta-programming)\n\n- Rich Scala ecosystem for complex protocols and mission-critical solutions\n\n(2) Benefits for businesses\n\nScalus, paired with Scala 3, helps businesses build on Cardano without the usual headaches. It's a practical way to deliver value quickly and reliably.\n\nBenefits:\n\n- Productivity boost at scale with Scala 3\n\n- Reduced time-to-market - from prototyping to production in less time\n\n- Deep pool of Scala/Java/Kotlin talent available on the market\n\n- Code quality and safety are first-class citizens\n\n- Reduced training investments to transition Scala/Java/Kotlin teams to blockchain\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOleksandr Nemish is a seasoned software engineer with a specialised focus on functional programming, type theory, meta-programming, compilers, and blockchains. His expertise is underscored by his proficiency in languages such as Scala, Haskell and Rust.\n\nOleksandr has a robust professional background, having worked for prominent financial organisations like Deutsche Bank and UBS.\n\nOleksandr Nemish is a former engineer at IOG, the engineering company behind the Cardano blockchain. He worked on the design and implementation of Marlowe -- a new financial smart contracts programming language for Cardano.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control.

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nCexplorer.io serves over 50,000 monthly users and processes millions of data requests, providing real-time, in-depth insights into Cardano's blockchain. It supports developers, SPOs, researchers, and everyday users with tools for exploring transactions, addresses, tokens, and stake pools. By improving transparency and accessibility, it reduces friction in dApp development, stake pool monitoring, and ecosystem analysis. The return on investment is a proven, high-traffic platform that continuously evolves to meet the growing demands of the Cardano community.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nCexplorer.io (formerly Adapools) has been live since 2020, serving over 50,000 monthly users and handling millions of data requests each month.\n\n- The team has strong experience in backend systems, frontend development, API design, and DevOps, specifically tailored to Cardano's architecture (e.g., DB-Sync, Cardano Node, CIPs).\n\n- Proven ability to maintain high availability, fast performance, and implement continuous improvements based on real user feedback.\n\n- The team is fully equipped to ensure long-term support, stability, and delivery of new features in a rapidly evolving ecosystem.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **A free Native Asset CDN for Cardano Developers** which will provide the following services:\n\nBuilding reliable infrastructure to display Cardano native assets (NFTs &FTs) efficiently, at scale, can cost upwards of $100,000 and take 9+ months of development effort. **We propose to deliver a free Native Asset Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Cardano, by making our existing NFTCDN services free to use for anyone building on Cardano**. NFTCDN has been operating since 2022 and provides fast, reliable and resilient multimedia and metadata delivery through a globally distributed CDN, enabling projects to display native assets effortlessly. By removing technical and financial barriers, NFTCDN allows developers to focus on product innovation and growth, accelerate time-to-market, and promotes wider adoption and implementation of native assets within apps across the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\n### Background - Native Assets\n\n- Native assets (NFTs & FTs) are widely used on Cardano across diverse use cases\n\n- Often used to store multimedia content - images, music, videos, documents, etc\n\n- Media is stored on decentralised systems - IPFS, Arweave, and on-chain embeds\n\n- Centralised storage options also used - HTTP, FTP & commercial cloud providers\n\n- File locations are referenced as links within the native asset's metadata\n\n### Pain Point - Technical Complexity\n\n- Accessing native asset media requires querying the blockchain (Cardano node + DB-Sync)\n\n- And fetching content via middleware (e.g. IPFS gateway/node)\n\n- Apps must handle this process programmatically, at scale, with robust exception handling\n\n- Developers face challenges from:\n\n- Human error (e.g. typos in metadata links)\n\n- Evolving standards (e.g. NFT v0.01, CIP-25, CIP-68)\n\n- Protocol updates (e.g. Chang HF impacting Node & DB-Sync)\n\n- Performance, efficiency, and reliability must be maintained across all layers\n\n- Apps must build and maintain complex, resilient backend infrastructure to support native asset display as both a capability & feature\n\n### Solution -- NFTCDN\n\n- NFTCDN is a managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider\n\n- Provides high-availability native asset media & metadata delivery via globally distributed, high-speed Content Delivery Network\n\n- Developers access content using only the native asset fingerprint ID - no complex setup needed\n\n- Eliminates the need to design, build, test, & maintain complex end-to-end infra\n\n- Enables focus on innovation of their product - not backend ops\n\n### Problem Statement - Cost to Build/Access\n\n- Building native asset delivery infra in-house costs ~$100,000 and 9+ months (internal benchmarks)\n\n- NFTCDN solves upfront CAPEX/OPEX needs\n\n- But we are a paid service (pay-per-API-call) - limiting adoption\n\n- Only well-funded teams have been able to integrate NFTCDN to date\n\n- Many projects cannot afford the cost, leading to delays, increased risk, or total shutdown\n\n- Market headwinds further impacted adoption, with some customers forced to shut down due to reduced user base",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n####  Proposal -- The Ask\n\n- Fund NFTCDN to make it free for all Cardano builders for 18 months under an SLA contract\n\n- Cover operational & infra scale-up costs to deliver enterprise-grade Native Asset CDN\n\n- Enables us to provide our solution to the Cardano community for free\n\n- Removes cost barriers, fuelling innovation, faster development, and wider adoption\n\n$5.5m cost avoidance opportunity & ~39,000 dev. hours savings for products seeking to integrate native asset display -- removing barriers to entry, faster new product launches, improved end-user exp. & increased innovation prospects.\n\n#### Tangible Benefits ($5.5m cost savings | 39,000 dev. hours savings | >17x ROI)\n\n* Eliminate up-front infrastructure costs (~$100,000 per product) for native asset display\n\n* Accelerate product development by 9+ months by removing the need to build and maintain complex, scalable infrastructure\n\n* Immediate cost avoidance opportunity of **~$1.5m** and **~23,400 developer hours** across 15+ existing NFTCDN customers\n\n* Additional cost avoidance opportunity of **~$1m** and **~15,600 developer hours** during proposal funding cycle by onboarding at least 10 additional products\n\n* Maintenance & operational cost avoidance of **$3m** for 25 NFTCDN users during proposal funding cycle\n\n* Proposal cost of ~$320k with a **ROI of 17.20x**\n\n# ROI Calculations Breakdown\n\n- **Typical development cost of infrastructure to support native asset display:**\n\n- ~9 months / 1,560 dev hours\n\n- ~$100k (developer, PM, infra) per product\n\n- **Typical annual running & maintenance cost:**\n\n- ~$100,000 in salaries for labour (back- & front-end, networking, storage, cyber security, admin)\n\n- ~$20,000 infra cost (servers, hosting, licenses)\n\n- **Tasks avoided by using NFTCDN:**\n\n- Cardano node + DB-Sync + Other Cardano software setup & upgrades\n\n- Middleware for native Asset metadata parsing (CIP-25, CIP-68, v0.01)\n\n- Middleware for metadata error and edge case handling\n\n- Integration with IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain storage systems/protocols\n\n- Middleware for multimedia content optimisation\n\n- Security handling (e.g., malware in native assets)\n\n- Real-time monitoring pipeline of native asset minting & updates\n\n- End-to-end routing pipeline, including maintenance and updating\n\n- Regulatory compliance review & management process overhead\n\n- Performance, reliability, and redundancy infrastructure\n\n- **Savings for Current NFTCDN Users (15 active projects)**\n\n- Dev Hours Savings = 23,400 (1,560 hrs x 15 current projects)\n\n- Labour & Infra Savings = $1.5M in cost avoidance ($100k x 15 current projects)\n\n- **Savings from +10 new projects onboarded during proposal period (conservative est.)**\n\n- Adds 15,600 dev. hours and $1M in additional savings for newly onboarded projects into NFTCDN for duration of proposal (18 months)\n\n- **Savings for on-going maint. & ops cost (25 projects)**\n\n- Adds $3m in additional savings ($100k + $20k x 25 total projects using NFTCDN)\n\n- **Total value returned:**\n\n- ~39,000 dev hours saved for initial development\n\n- ~$5.5M total ecosystem cost avoidance\n\n- **Proposal cost:** ~$320k\n\n- **Estimated ROI:** ~17.2x\n\n- Equivalent of ~19 years of cumulative dev time saved\n\n####  Intangible Benefits\n\n* **Removes Adoption Barriers** - Eliminates financial (OPEX/CAPEX) & technical (dev. complexity) barriers to entry\n\n* **Accelerates Time-to-Market** - Enables fast and easy integration of native asset features/capabilities\n\n* **Frees Up Product Teams** - Reduces backend overhead, letting teams focus on core feature dev, growth & adoption\n\n* **Boosts Developer Adoption** - Makes accessible for early-stage, under/unfunded and community (free-product) builders\n\n* **Enables Broader Innovation** - Enables exploration of new native asset use cases (RWA, identity, media, education)\n\n* **Future-Proof Native Asset Delivery** - Adapts to evolving standards; all users benefit from shared upgrades and fixes\n\n* **Eliminates Redundancy** - Shared infrastructure avoids every project building redundant, costly systems\n\n* **Improves End-User Experience** - A high-speed, enterprise-grade, globally distributed CDN for multimedia content substantially improves loading speeds\n\n* **Drives Ecosystem Growth** -- Native asset adoption across more apps creates compounding utility and user adoption\n\n* **Aligns with Cardano's Goals & Roadmap** -- Directly supports Cardano's 2025 roadmaps goals around simplifying developer experience, increasing real-world utility and improving end-user experience\n\n# Aligns w/ Proposed Cardano 2025 Goals & Roadmap\n\n* \"Get More Usage\" Category\n\n* Goal: Attract DApps and users - product market fit\n\n* Goal: Easier to build on and to use Cardano\n\n* Goal: Cardano competitive option\n\n* Goal: Clear funding mechanisms\n\n* \"Developer/User Experience\" Category\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\n# About NFTCDN\n\n* Established in 2022\n\n* Testnet (Preview & Pre-Prod) and Mainnet coverage of all native assets\n\n* Service(s) offered on pay-per-API-use tiered pricing model\n\n* Existing customers include Verspr, Eternl, Tokeo, NEWM, NMKR, Pool.pm\n\n* Have served 800+ million API requests as of April-2025\n\n* Currently running with 100% uptime since launch\n\n# How is NFTCDN different from a basic CDN (e.g. Cloudflare, Vercel, etc)\n\n- **NFTCDN is purpose-built for Cardano**: NFTCDN is more than a CDN. Direct API access to `/metadata`, `/image`, `/file` native assets using only their fingerprint ID. Cloudflare offers no blockchain/NFT support; this would have to be custom built by devs.\n\n- **Multi-protocol/system support**: NFTCDN auto-handles multimedia storage fetching from IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain. Cloudflare requires devs to build fetch/parsing logic manually on their own infra setup.\n\n- **Standards-aware infra**: NFTCDN supports CIP-25, 68, v0.01 and adapts as they evolve. Cloudflare has no protocol awareness - devs must implement parsing module compliance manually and cater for human error and edge cases.\n\n- **No infra required**: NFTCDN handles full resolution flow (parsing, error fall-back, and format support) out of the box. Cloudflare needs origin setup and content pre-hosted on their proprietary solutions.\n\n- **Real-time chain indexing**: Native assets state updated live (minting & updating) from chain. Cloudflare requires manual indexing, pointer mgmt, and cache invalidation.\n\n- **Cloudflare TOS risk**: Large or non-web file caching (image, audio, video, 3D files) is restricted; in-production use will violate TOS unless using proprietary paid products (Stream/Images/R2, c. ~$5k+/yr).\n\n- **Global cross-app caching**: NFTCDN caches assets at the asset level, so cache `HITS` benefit all products (websites & dApps). Cloudflare caches per domain/site - no sharing resulting in low CDN performance resulting in higher cache `MISS` states.\n\n- **Built-in content safety**: NFTCDN provides CSP headers + dev. controls over rendering. Cloudflare lacks native asset-specific safeguards, increasing risk of suspension due to embedded malicious multimedia content.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH.

				"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **A free Native Asset CDN for Cardano Developers** which will provide the following services:\n\nBuilding reliable infrastructure to display Cardano native assets (NFTs &FTs) efficiently, at scale, can cost upwards of $100,000 and take 9+ months of development effort. **We propose to deliver a free Native Asset Content Delivery Network (CDN) for Cardano, by making our existing NFTCDN services free to use for anyone building on Cardano**. NFTCDN has been operating since 2022 and provides fast, reliable and resilient multimedia and metadata delivery through a globally distributed CDN, enabling projects to display native assets effortlessly. By removing technical and financial barriers, NFTCDN allows developers to focus on product innovation and growth, accelerate time-to-market, and promotes wider adoption and implementation of native assets within apps across the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\n### Background - Native Assets\n\n- Native assets (NFTs & FTs) are widely used on Cardano across diverse use cases\n\n- Often used to store multimedia content - images, music, videos, documents, etc\n\n- Media is stored on decentralised systems - IPFS, Arweave, and on-chain embeds\n\n- Centralised storage options also used - HTTP, FTP & commercial cloud providers\n\n- File locations are referenced as links within the native asset's metadata\n\n### Pain Point - Technical Complexity\n\n- Accessing native asset media requires querying the blockchain (Cardano node + DB-Sync)\n\n- And fetching content via middleware (e.g. IPFS gateway/node)\n\n- Apps must handle this process programmatically, at scale, with robust exception handling\n\n- Developers face challenges from:\n\n- Human error (e.g. typos in metadata links)\n\n- Evolving standards (e.g. NFT v0.01, CIP-25, CIP-68)\n\n- Protocol updates (e.g. Chang HF impacting Node & DB-Sync)\n\n- Performance, efficiency, and reliability must be maintained across all layers\n\n- Apps must build and maintain complex, resilient backend infrastructure to support native asset display as both a capability & feature\n\n### Solution -- NFTCDN\n\n- NFTCDN is a managed Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider\n\n- Provides high-availability native asset media & metadata delivery via globally distributed, high-speed Content Delivery Network\n\n- Developers access content using only the native asset fingerprint ID - no complex setup needed\n\n- Eliminates the need to design, build, test, & maintain complex end-to-end infra\n\n- Enables focus on innovation of their product - not backend ops\n\n### Problem Statement - Cost to Build/Access\n\n- Building native asset delivery infra in-house costs ~$100,000 and 9+ months (internal benchmarks)\n\n- NFTCDN solves upfront CAPEX/OPEX needs\n\n- But we are a paid service (pay-per-API-call) - limiting adoption\n\n- Only well-funded teams have been able to integrate NFTCDN to date\n\n- Many projects cannot afford the cost, leading to delays, increased risk, or total shutdown\n\n- Market headwinds further impacted adoption, with some customers forced to shut down due to reduced user base",

Direct API access to `/metadata`, `/image`, `/file` native assets using only their fingerprint ID. Cloudflare offers no blockchain/NFT support; this would have to be custom built by devs.\n\n- **Multi-protocol/system support**: NFTCDN auto-handles multimedia storage fetching from IPFS, Arweave, HTTP, on-chain. Cloudflare requires devs to build fetch/parsing logic manually on their own infra setup.\n\n- **Standards-aware infra**: NFTCDN supports CIP-25, 68, v0.01 and adapts as they evolve. Cloudflare has no protocol awareness - devs must implement parsing module compliance manually and cater for human error and edge cases.\n\n- **No infra required**: NFTCDN handles full resolution flow (parsing, error fall-back, and format support) out of the box. Cloudflare needs origin setup and content pre-hosted on their proprietary solutions.\n\n- **Real-time chain indexing**: Native assets state updated live (minting & updating) from chain. Cloudflare requires manual indexing, pointer mgmt, and cache invalidation.\n\n- **Cloudflare TOS risk**: Large or non-web file caching (image, audio, video, 3D files) is restricted; in-production use will violate TOS unless using proprietary paid products (Stream/Images/R2, c. ~$5k+/yr).\n\n- **Global cross-app caching**: NFTCDN caches assets at the asset level, so cache `HITS` benefit all products (websites & dApps). Cloudflare caches per domain/site - no sharing resulting in low CDN performance resulting in higher cache `MISS` states.\n\n- **Built-in content safety**: NFTCDN provides CSP headers + dev. controls over rendering. Cloudflare lacks native asset-specific safeguards, increasing risk of suspension due to embedded malicious multimedia content.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer** which will provide the following services:\n\nWe propose to continue development and support of the AdaStat.net Cardano blockchain explorer for the next 24 months. Planned work includes performance optimizations, improvements to UX/UI, and new features related to Cardano's evolving governance model and on-chain tooling.\n\nThe frontend is developed using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, which allows very small bundle size and fast loading time on different devices. The backend is built on Node.js and PostgreSQL, combining standard DB-Sync tables with custom-optimized indexes for high-speed data access. This dual approach enables advanced search and filtering across both on-chain and off-chain metadata --- including DRep names, stake pool tickers, token labels, and more.\n\nInfrastructure is horizontally scalable. Multiple backend servers work behind load balancer and handle traffic based on real-time utilization. This gives high availability and stable performance, even during peak usage.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nIt's still a challenge to provide Cardano blockchain data in a way that's both decentralized and easy to use. Blockchain explorers are key tools in solving this issue, as they provide access to information about blocks, transactions, stake pools, governance activities, and other on-chain operations. However, each explorer is also potential point of centralization --- it can fail, or show incorrect data. Because of this, it is important for ecosystem to have several independent, performant, and open-source explorers.\n\nAdaStat.net supports this goal by providing real-time, mobile-optimized, and feature-rich explorer for Cardano. Maintaining and improving AdaStat directly strengthens the ecosystem infrastructure, increase transparency of data, and offer valuable tool for SPOs, DReps, CC members, developers, and everyday users.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n1. For SPOs: Real-time access to block production and stake pool performance, without delays from epoch boundaries or outdated data.\n\n2. For DReps and CC members: Tools for tracking governance activities and accessing voting-related data in clear and transparent way.\n\n3. For developers: Access to fully free REST API that provides Cardano data in easy-to-use JSON format --- helpful for building tools, dashboards, or integrating blockchain data into other applications.\n\n4. For general users: The site works smoothly on all devices, and we keep improving it based on user feedback.\n\n5. For the Cardano ecosystem: AdaStat is a lightweight and open tool that helps Cardano stay decentralized and easy to understand - especially for new users. All of this helps Cardano grow: stronger infrastructure, clearer data, and better long-term adoption.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nAdaStat.net has been actively developed and maintained since Shelley Incentivized Testnet in 2019, with consistent uptime, feature updates, and strong organic community usage. The team has years of experience working with Cardano node, DB-Sync, performance tuning, database optimization, and community engagement. This shows that we've been consistently improving the project over the years, and we plan to keep doing so.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Planned work includes performance optimizations, improvements to UX/UI, and new features related to Cardano's evolving governance model and on-chain tooling.\n\nThe frontend is developed using Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, which allows very small bundle size and fast loading time on different devices. The backend is built on Node.js and PostgreSQL, combining standard DB-Sync tables with custom-optimized indexes for high-speed data access. This dual approach enables advanced search and filtering across both on-chain and off-chain metadata --- including DRep names, stake pool tickers, token labels, and more.\n\nInfrastructure is horizontally scalable. Multiple backend servers work behind load balancer and handle traffic based on real-time utilization. This gives high availability and stable performance, even during peak usage.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh.

				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nIt's still a challenge to provide Cardano blockchain data in a way that's both decentralized and easy to use. Blockchain explorers are key tools in solving this issue, as they provide access to information about blocks, transactions, stake pools, governance activities, and other on-chain operations. However, each explorer is also potential point of centralization --- it can fail, or show incorrect data. Because of this, it is important for ecosystem to have several independent, performant, and open-source explorers.\n\nAdaStat.net supports this goal by providing real-time, mobile-optimized, and feature-rich explorer for Cardano. Maintaining and improving AdaStat directly strengthens the ecosystem infrastructure, increase transparency of data, and offer valuable tool for SPOs, DReps, CC members, developers, and everyday users.",

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs Cardano enters the age of Voltaire, governance is transitioning from a small number of founding organizations to a decentralized global community. While the introduction of a constitution and on-chain voting forms the structural backbone, these mechanisms alone are not enough to sustain a functional decentralized system. What's needed in parallel is community-aligned coordination - infrastructure that enables participation, promotes continuity, and supports informed decision-making across the network.\n\nIntersect is also responsible for the stewardship of Cardano's core Haskell codebases, including the repositories that power the core Cardano node. This role involves more than maintenance - it includes coordinating new releases, aligning contributors around engineering best practices, and ensuring that upgrades are ready for safe deployment. Intersect acts as a neutral facilitator in this process, helping translate new feature proposals from ecosystem vendors into stable, tested releases that can be confidently adopted across the network.\n\nIntersect has played a central role in coordinating ecosystem-wide upgrades, including the successful deployment of the Chang and Plomin hard forks. These upgrades required aligning infrastructure providers, SPOs, dApps, and exchanges globally - a process demanding deep technical coordination, ecosystem trust, and communications capacity.\n\nBeyond technical infrastructure, Intersect provides a collaborative space for governance to mature and grow, supporting over 30 working groups and eight elected committees made up of Cardano community members. These committees focus on key areas such as budgeting, product development, open source, membership, growth, and technical standards - offering non-binding recommendations and practical insight to on-chain actors like DReps and SPOs.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThis proposal enables Intersect to continue providing essential infrastructure, coordination, and governance support for Cardano during a pivotal 12-month period from June 2025 to June 2026.\n\nSpecifically, this proposal will fund Intersect to:\n\nSteward core infrastructure\n\n- Maintain and govern the open-source Cardano node repositories, including the Haskell codebases\n\n- Coordinate and release upgrades proposed by ecosystem contributors, ensuring safe deployment, roadmap alignment, and stakeholder readiness\n\n- Provide stability and continuity across key engineering practices and upgrade cycles\n\nExecute the Administrator role\n\n- Continue fulfilling the responsibilities of the \"Administrator\" role defined in the Constitution.\n\n- Provide contract and oversight support, including proposal vetting, operational execution, smart contract development, and compliance monitoring\n\n- Act as a reliable counterparty for Treasury-funded initiatives, offering arbitration routes while supporting increased transparency and decentralization\n\nSupport participation and coordination\n\n- Deliver stipends to elected committee members --- beginning formal recognition of their time and expertise\n\n- Facilitate an election process to confirm a new Constitutional Committee\n\n- Provide professional operational and coordination support to 8 committees and 30+ working groups\n\n- Provide through our members, onboarding, tools, and resources for DReps, SPOs, and the Constitutional Committee\n\nFacilitate roadmap and budget processes\n\n- Via the Product Committee, facilitating product roadmap development and long-term ecosystem vision\n\n- Rebuilding a budget process for 2026 and coordinating the delivery and on-chain submission of a 2026 budget\n\n- Conceptualize and operationalize a scalable RFP process for committee-aligned budget proposals (example the Open Source Committee proposal)\n\nExpand Ecosystem Capacity\n\n- Support the emergence of new MBOs, associations, and working groups\n\n- Recognize and reinforce the need for multiple Administrators in the future to support a plural and scalable governance model\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nOur leadership:\n\nJack Briggs - Interim Executive Director\n\n- As of April 25, 2025, Jack now leads Intersect as our Interim Executive Director and will be reaffirming Intersect's mission and core purpose --- bringing Intersect back to serve the community as a lean, accountable, and principled enabler of open collaboration, where decisions are transparent, power is distributed, and progress is driven by those who build and contribute.\n\n- Jack brings over a decade of experience leading large teams for global organizations such as Vodafone and Three Mobile, as well as multiple technology startups, including those focused on open source. Outside of technology, he was twice elected Chairman of a large residents' association representing over 150 households, and in 2018, he stood as a candidate in the UK local elections for a national party.\n\n- Passionate about blockchain, Jack started with Bitcoin in 2012, Ethereum in 2017, and Cardano in 2019. From 2021, he was one of the earliest contributors to Cardano's governance design, including collaborating on the first version of CIP-1694.\n\nNick Cook - Interim Director of Operations\n\n- Nick is an experienced, driven and energetic leader with a proven history of working in the Web3, blockchain, fintech and AI space. Nick has played a critical part in establishing community hubs for Intersect, linking the company with the wider Cardano community. His work has been invaluable for engaging members with our broader mission.\n\nThe Board of Directors are now working on an open recruitment strategy with members at the forefront in confirming a permanent Executive Director.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Governing Board and Executive team at Intersect, with a Legal Contract established between Intersect and the CDH. Intersect will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the SundaeSwap platform. These details will be shared as part of the budget management tooling process.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored and reported by Intersect's Executive team and will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

				"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **A member-based organization for the Cardano ecosystem: Intersect** which will provide the following services:\n\nIntersect exists to serve as a neutral, nonprofit coordination layer that bridges decentralized governance and decentralized infrastructure. Our mission is not to direct the network, but to enable it. By stewarding core systems, supporting community-led processes, and facilitating safe, transparent delivery.\n\nSpecifically, this proposal will fund Intersect to:\n\n- Steward core infrastructure\n\n- Execute the Administrator role\n\n- Support participation and coordination\n\n- Facilitate roadmap and budget processes\n\n- Expand ecosystem capacity\n\nNote: Intersect's original proposal submitted early in the off-chain process was updated after recent leadership changes. However, this proposal reflects the approved Budget Info Action and new strategic direction.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs Cardano enters the age of Voltaire, governance is transitioning from a small number of founding organizations to a decentralized global community. While the introduction of a constitution and on-chain voting forms the structural backbone, these mechanisms alone are not enough to sustain a functional decentralized system. What's needed in parallel is community-aligned coordination - infrastructure that enables participation, promotes continuity, and supports informed decision-making across the network.\n\nIntersect is also responsible for the stewardship of Cardano's core Haskell codebases, including the repositories that power the core Cardano node. This role involves more than maintenance - it includes coordinating new releases, aligning contributors around engineering best practices, and ensuring that upgrades are ready for safe deployment. Intersect acts as a neutral facilitator in this process, helping translate new feature proposals from ecosystem vendors into stable, tested releases that can be confidently adopted across the network.\n\nIntersect has played a central role in coordinating ecosystem-wide upgrades, including the successful deployment of the Chang and Plomin hard forks. These upgrades required aligning infrastructure providers, SPOs, dApps, and exchanges globally - a process demanding deep technical coordination, ecosystem trust, and communications capacity.\n\nBeyond technical infrastructure, Intersect provides a collaborative space for governance to mature and grow, supporting over 30 working groups and eight elected committees made up of Cardano community members. These committees focus on key areas such as budgeting, product development, open source, membership, growth, and technical standards - offering non-binding recommendations and practical insight to on-chain actors like DReps and SPOs.",

The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nOur leadership:\n\nJack Briggs - Interim Executive Director\n\n- As of April 25, 2025, Jack now leads Intersect as our Interim Executive Director and will be reaffirming Intersect's mission and core purpose --- bringing Intersect back to serve the community as a lean, accountable, and principled enabler of open collaboration, where decisions are transparent, power is distributed, and progress is driven by those who build and contribute.\n\n- Jack brings over a decade of experience leading large teams for global organizations such as Vodafone and Three Mobile, as well as multiple technology startups, including those focused on open source. Outside of technology, he was twice elected Chairman of a large residents' association representing over 150 households, and in 2018, he stood as a candidate in the UK local elections for a national party.\n\n- Passionate about blockchain, Jack started with Bitcoin in 2012, Ethereum in 2017, and Cardano in 2019. From 2021, he was one of the earliest contributors to Cardano's governance design, including collaborating on the first version of CIP-1694.\n\nNick Cook - Interim Director of Operations\n\n- Nick is an experienced, driven and energetic leader with a proven history of working in the Web3, blockchain, fintech and AI space. Nick has played a critical part in establishing community hubs for Intersect, linking the company with the wider Cardano community. His work has been invaluable for engaging members with our broader mission.\n\nThe Board of Directors are now working on an open recruitment strategy with members at the forefront in confirming a permanent Executive Director.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Governing Board and Executive team at Intersect, with a Legal Contract established between Intersect and the CDH. Intersect will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the SundaeSwap platform. These details will be shared as part of the budget management tooling process.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored and reported by Intersect's Executive team and will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Beyond Minimum Viable Governance: Iteratively Improving on Cardano Voltaire** which will provide the following services:\n\nThis initiative will establish a robust framework for evaluating and enhancing Cardano's governance system. We will identify and benchmark key governance metrics to assess the health, performance, and overall impact of our decentralized decision-making processes. The resulting 'State of Governance' report will provide a structured evaluation of participation, track vital Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), map the evolving governance ecosystem, and pinpoint specific areas for improvement.\n\nTo ensure our findings are grounded in real-world experience, we will engage the Cardano community through various channels. These include virtual workshops, targeted surveys, and in-depth user interviews. By actively gathering and synthesizing community insights, we will gain a comprehensive understanding of the current state of governance. This will allow us to formulate actionable recommendations and pave the way for post-MVG (Minimum Viable Governance) evolution. Where appropriate, these recommendations will be developed into initial drafts of Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs) or Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), directly reflecting the community's vision for a more robust and effective governance future.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCardano stands at the forefront of decentralized governance innovation. Yet, we face a critical challenge: the absence of transparent, data-backed frameworks to evaluate our governance's effectiveness, pinpoint obstacles, and drive impactful improvements. Without these structured processes, our governance discourse risks becoming reactive and fragmented. Potential risks may slip through the cracks, and decision-makers could lack the vital insights needed to refine our governance mechanisms. To truly evolve beyond Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) and unlock Cardano's full potential, we must establish a robust, data-driven foundation for continuous improvement.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nImagine a Cardano where governance evolves continuously, driven by data and community insights. We will forge that future by moving beyond Minimum Viable Governance (MVG) to craft a dynamic, adaptable system with a clear, cost-effective process to pinpoint the real challenges faced by those who participate in governance. By putting this process into action, we will deliver transparent, insightful findings and expert analysis. Where needed, these insights will be translated into concrete proposals (CIPs or CPSs) reflecting community consensus. This initiative will kickstart ongoing governance optimization, empowering the community to actively monitor and address critical risks, ensuring Cardano remains a leader in decentralized decision-making.\n\n* The process outputs will be published including a state of governance report with measurement methods and workshop data with analysis\n\n* A playbook will be published with details about how to repeat the process and include lessons learned\n\n* Any CPS and CIPs will be authored by this team as a milestone of this funding, but the team will be open for other interested co-authors and collaborators\n\n* Further funding would be required to move a CPS to a CIP, or to implement a CIP\n\n* This could become a repeated process if the community finds value in funding these activities annually\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThis project will be driven by a robust coalition of experienced stakeholders dedicated to the advancement of Cardano's governance. Input Output's Voltaire team will provide core leadership, leveraging their unique role as the architects of Cardano's governance framework. As the team responsible for implementing key governance mechanisms---including the Cardano Constitution, the DRep liquid democracy model, and various on-chain and off-chain tools---we possess strong insight into their performance and optimization potential.\n\n**Key Contributions from Input Output's Voltaire Team:**\n\n* **CIP-1694 Workshops:** Designed and executed community workshops that were crucial in refining CIP-1694, which is now implemented on Cardano.\n\n* **Constitution Drafting:** Led the design and execution of the global constitution drafting workshops, which led to the 85% on-chain approval of the constitution. Michael Madoff served as the founding Chair of the Cardano Civics Committee, Danielle Stanko was the Secretary and led the Constitution Ratification Working Group, and Thomas Upfield managed the delivery of global workshop and convention polling tools during this process.\n\n* **CIP Authoring:** Demonstrated experience in creating and contributing to Cardano Improvement Proposals: Thomas Upfield is the author of CIP-119, and Danielle Stanko is the co-author of CIP-120.\n\n**Broader Coalition and Community Involvement:**\n\nThis project will not solely rely on Input Output. We are building a broad coalition with active participation from:\n\n* **Constitutional Delegate Committee Members:** Ken-Erik Ølmheim, Max van Rossem, and Tevo Saks, all experienced Cardano contributors, have committed to supporting this project, bringing valuable expertise as Workshop Hosts.\n\n* **Partner Organizations:** We have secured commitments from key partner organizations, including WADA and the Intersect Constitution team, to contribute to the project's delivery.\n\n* **Active Cardano Community Members:** We will actively engage with and draw upon the diverse expertise within the broader Cardano community, ensuring a truly collaborative and inclusive approach.\n\n**This collaborative model ensures a wide range of perspectives and expertise, enhancing the project's depth and impact on Cardano's governance evolution.**\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs participation increases and the demands of funding and governance become more complex, this proposal aims to address five key challenges necessary for Cardano's continued growth, competitiveness, and decentralization:\n\n1. **Operational inefficiencies:** Catalyst currently depends on substantial manual oversight and coordination across its funding cycles. Without targeted investment in tooling and automation, operational overhead will remain high. Streamlining systems now lays the groundwork for a leaner, more cost-effective operation once this development roadmap concludes in 2026.\n\n2. **Low voter engagement:** While Catalyst sees higher voter engagement than most blockchain ecosystems, participation remains disproportionately low relative to the total ADA in circulation. This imbalance raises questions about how representative funding decisions truly are of the broader Cardano community.\n\n3. **Software limitations:** Fragmented tools and inconsistent user workflows create friction across the entire Catalyst journey - from proposal to review to vote to ongoing project-funding administration and transparent outcomes. This complexity deters newcomers and reduces the system's inclusivity and scalability.\n\n4. **Voting power concentration:** A small number of high-stake wallets have the potential to dominate decision-making, leading to concerns around fairness and influence. Planned reforms like Quadratic Voting and DRep delegation are essential steps toward more equitable governance.\n\n5. **Catalyst's early-stage focus:** While Catalyst excels at incubating early-stage ideas and pilot programs, its role is sometimes mistaken for a long-term funding source. Clarifying Catalyst as a launchpad for experimentation and industry adoption, while encouraging mature projects not focused on partnerships to seek alternative treasury channels---will help align expectations and optimize resource allocation",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThis proposal addresses the need for reliable ecosystem funding to support hundreds of Cardano builders and startups, alongside upgrading the core structural and operational limitations facing Catalyst, laying the foundation for its long-term sustainability and decentralization. Through these three interlinked workstreams: Catalyst Interface Development, Hermes Decentralized Infrastructure, and the execution of three Funding Rounds the return on investment for this proposal is measured in tangible, ecosystem-wide outcomes, including:\n\n1. **For the Ecosystem:** Significant reduction in operational costs, with potential savings of up to 50% in future Catalyst cycles from 2026 onward and broader and more meaningful community participation by strengthening Cardano's decentralized innovation funding infrastructure with expanded governance functionality and funding flexibility, with support for multiple voting mechanics and the ability to participate using Cardano Native Tokens beyond ADA.\n\n2. **For Cardano Developers, Entrepreneurs, and Community Builders:** Continued assurance of community-led funding, giving hundreds of community builders the confidence to plan and scale their projects, supported by a trusted, experienced, and committed Catalyst operations team. ₳61 million to be deployed across three funding rounds, including the launch of a Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF) initiative, designed to reward high-impact contributions that have already been delivered - even if not initially funded through a Catalyst vote. The results are increased support for early stage R&D, open-source, regional, and community-led initiatives, guided by more equitable and representative voting mechanisms.\n\n3. **For End Users :** Seamless, scalable, and accessible Catalyst infrastructure delivered through unified, device-agnostic interfaces lowering barriers to participation, particularly in mobile-first regions, enabled by enhanced user interfaces and experience and production-grade decentralized infrastructure powered by Hermes, replacing legacy federated systems with peer-to-peer architecture. The sum of these parts aligns directly with Cardano's broader goals of decentralization, transparency, and system resilience. Plus the introduction of optionality between delegated and direct voting that improves governance legitimacy, with greater transparency, auditability, and resilience across funding and decision-making processes due to investment in interfaces and infrastructure.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe Catalyst Team brings over four years of experience delivering the Catalyst program. Since 2021, the Catalyst Team has processed over 3 million governance decisions, allocated ₳290 million to 2091 projects from 114 countries in 6 continents, and operated 13 successful funding rounds with a well-established governance, compliance, technology, transparency and accountability framework. Catalyst's Fund Operations team has facilitated more than 12,000 individual payments to grantees, totaling ₳180,274,235 in addition to tens of thousands more payments for incentivised community roles demonstrating its commitment to operational and financial compliance integrity. The Catalyst technical team has pioneered decentralized voting solutions, including privacy-preserving voting, quadratic voting, and the development of a prototype Hermes engine in Cardano. The team remains committed to engaging the community to enhance the program's capabilities and to furthering Cardano's ecosystem growth and development.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

				"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nAs participation increases and the demands of funding and governance become more complex, this proposal aims to address five key challenges necessary for Cardano's continued growth, competitiveness, and decentralization:\n\n1. **Operational inefficiencies:** Catalyst currently depends on substantial manual oversight and coordination across its funding cycles. Without targeted investment in tooling and automation, operational overhead will remain high. Streamlining systems now lays the groundwork for a leaner, more cost-effective operation once this development roadmap concludes in 2026.\n\n2. **Low voter engagement:** While Catalyst sees higher voter engagement than most blockchain ecosystems, participation remains disproportionately low relative to the total ADA in circulation. This imbalance raises questions about how representative funding decisions truly are of the broader Cardano community.\n\n3. **Software limitations:** Fragmented tools and inconsistent user workflows create friction across the entire Catalyst journey - from proposal to review to vote to ongoing project-funding administration and transparent outcomes. This complexity deters newcomers and reduces the system's inclusivity and scalability.\n\n4. **Voting power concentration:** A small number of high-stake wallets have the potential to dominate decision-making, leading to concerns around fairness and influence. Planned reforms like Quadratic Voting and DRep delegation are essential steps toward more equitable governance.\n\n5. **Catalyst's early-stage focus:** While Catalyst excels at incubating early-stage ideas and pilot programs, its role is sometimes mistaken for a long-term funding source. Clarifying Catalyst as a launchpad for experimentation and industry adoption, while encouraging mature projects not focused on partnerships to seek alternative treasury channels---will help align expectations and optimize resource allocation",

This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThe Cardano ecosystem currently faces challenges in establishing a consistent and impactful presence at global blockchain events. Catalyst-funded initiatives often operate under independent branding which rarely mentions 'Cardano' which dilutes the visibility of Cardano within the broader blockchain community. This fragmented approach makes it harder for Cardano to stand out amidst the competition.\n\nCompetitors like Solana, Aptos, and Sui have established significant brand recognition by strategically aligning global events with developer-focused initiatives.\n\nTheir series of hacker houses and hubs---typically held 3--4 times per year---have successfully fostered active developer communities and increased Total Value Locked (TVL) on their platforms. These events seamlessly blend ecosystems, attracting talent and partnerships across multiple chains while solidifying their reputation as innovative blockchain leaders.\n\nWithout a similarly coordinated and impactful event strategy, Cardano risks being overshadowed in a competitive landscape. A fresh approach to event planning is essential to position Cardano alongside top players and attract developers, partners, and enthusiasts from across the blockchain ecosystem.",

They will run a 100% Cardano-focused events and marketing campaign globally at the most cost-efficient manner leveraging our wealth of event experience.\n\nList of Key Events: [https://ucarecdn.com/601623d5-e9ef-45ec-9025-1e7cd40f824c/External2025EventsListCleanlist_14April.pdf](https://ucarecdn.com/601623d5-e9ef-45ec-9025-1e7cd40f824c/External2025EventsListCleanlist_14April.pdf)\n\nUnveiling the First Unified Global Events Marketing Strategy for Cardano PDF:\n\n[https://ucarecdn.com/0830cd4a-dec8-4595-8a27-2a680788e90d/Cardano2025EventProposalUpdatedMarch.pdf](https://ucarecdn.com/0830cd4a-dec8-4595-8a27-2a680788e90d/Cardano2025EventProposalUpdatedMarch.pdf)\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nCardano Foundation: An independent, Swiss-based non-profit organization tasked with advancing the public digital infrastructure of Cardano and working to anchor it as a utility for financial and social systems\n\nEmurgo: EMURGO is a blockchain technology company and a founding entity of the Cardano blockchain that provides products and services to drive the adoption of Cardano's Web3 ecosystem. Established in Japan, EMURGO exists to facilitate commercial growth of the Cardano ecosystem and unlock the full potential of the ecosystem through partnerships, investments, education, and infrastructure development.\n\nRare Network: Rare Network is a premier event services, KOL (Key Opinion Leader), and marketing company dedicated to promoting businesses within the blockchain technology and Web3 space. As the parent group of RareEvo.io, Rare Network specializes in creating impactful events and innovative marketing strategies that drive visibility and growth for pioneering companies in the decentralized technology ecosystem\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Catalyst-funded initiatives often operate under independent branding which rarely mentions 'Cardano' which dilutes the visibility of Cardano within the broader blockchain community. This fragmented approach makes it harder for Cardano to stand out amidst the competition.\n\nCompetitors like Solana, Aptos, and Sui have established significant brand recognition by strategically aligning global events with developer-focused initiatives.\n\nTheir series of hacker houses and hubs---typically held 3--4 times per year---have successfully fostered active developer communities and increased Total Value Locked (TVL) on their platforms. These events seamlessly blend ecosystems, attracting talent and partnerships across multiple chains while solidifying their reputation as innovative blockchain leaders.\n\nWithout a similarly coordinated and impactful event strategy, Cardano risks being overshadowed in a competitive landscape. A fresh approach to event planning is essential to position Cardano alongside top players and attract developers, partners, and enthusiasts from across the blockchain ecosystem.",

		"abstract": "This treasury withdrawal funds **Cardano Builder DAO** which will provide the following services:\n\nThe Cardano Builder DAO (**CB DAO**) is a **smart contract-enforced**, **member-governed funding mechanism** created to **support the application-layer growth of the Cardano ecosystem**. Its core purpose is to **provide sustainable financial backing** and **strategic oversight to high-impact projects** that are directly responsible for existing user adoption, on-chain activity, Total Value Locked (TVL), and ecosystem engagement.\n\nWhile Cardano's governance structure and funding mechanisms, such as Project Catalyst and core development committees, have been instrumental in bootstrapping protocol advancements and open-source tooling, **there remains a substantial gap in ongoing support for live, user-facing products/services. CB DAO fills that gap.**\n\nThrough a **transparent governance framework**, **strict accountability mechanisms**, and a **metrics-first funding approach**, CB DAO ensures that builders with growing products on mainnet can scale sustainably, integrate cutting-edge Cardano infrastructure (e.g. Hydra, Leios, Midgard), and contribute to the ecosystem's long-term growth.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor. The following sections; Abstract, Motivation, Rationale and Vendor Profile have been sourced from the approved proposal submitted by the Vendor as part of the Intersect budget process.\n\nThis treasury withdrawal funds one of 39 proposals to give effect to the approved budget info action for ₳275,269,340, administered by Intersect via gov_action1u9x73kwufaxa70lfy59g4ynwyrcsaxdcd0gxzzmh67s9fxq4j8hqqk2phgh. The information provided herein is intended to fulfill the spirit of the constitutional requirement for a treasury withdrawal info action by also providing the details of the proposed solution, alignment to the budget, and amount to be withdrawn from the Cardano Treasury.",
		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nThis proposal seeks to address the lack of dedicated, sustainable financial support and strategic oversight for functioning dApps that drive real usage, transaction volume, and Total Value Locked (TVL) on the Cardano blockchain.\n\nWhile Cardano has mechanisms for new protocol development and early-stage funding, there is currently no infrastructure specifically designed to financially support application-layer projects that are already live on mainnet and which are driving Cardano's current user activity. Without targeted support, these projects risk stagnation, limiting Cardano's broader adoption and on-chain ecosystem growth.\n\nTo reach mass adoption, Cardano needs to better support launched projects; this proposal aims to ensure that established builders with launched dApps can continue to build on Cardano.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIf implemented, this proposal will directly benefit Cardano dApp developers, the broader ecosystem of users, and ADA holders by creating a reliable funding structure focused on sustained adoption, utility, and on-chain economic activity.\n\nDemonstrated value to the Cardano Community includes:\n\n* **Increased On-Chain Activity**: Providing financial support to launched projects with real users and measurable transactions will grow Cardano's usage metrics, a key indicator of network health and success.\n\n* **Higher TVL and Ecosystem Stickiness**: By supporting projects that retain user assets on-chain, the DAO boosts Cardano's DeFi footprint and TVL.\n\n* **More Reliable Infrastructure & Products**: Developers gain access to capital that enables consistent product development, user support, and innovation.\n\n* **Greater Visibility and Adoption**: Supporting high-impact applications increases Cardano's competitiveness in the broader Web3 landscape, attracting new users and developers.\n\n* **Transparent ROI Tracking**: Funded projects must report KPIs like transaction counts, active users, and commit activity, enabling the community to clearly measure the impact and return on funding decisions.\n\n* **Balance Ecosystem Funding Structure**: This purpose-built funding mechanism complements Project Catalyst by creating a clear delineation between the different development stages of projects, and where they should seek funding within the ecosystem. This enables Project Catalyst to be a more effective innovation engine as larger projects will not rely on Project Catalyst for funding.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team is responsible for building and maintaining Clarity, a governance platform purpose-built for the Cardano ecosystem. Clarity serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with Agora, an open-source, audited library of smart contracts designed for decentralized governance and treasury management.\n\nWe have already deployed this infrastructure in production and actively maintain it. Our smart contracts have governed over $10 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and are used by four DAOs, each managing six-figure treasuries on-chain. These DAOs use the same tooling and processes that CB DAO will leverage, including member-based voting, proposal submission, temperature checks, and treasury execution fully enforced by smart contracts.\n\nIn addition to our technical capabilities, we work directly with Cardano ecosystem founders and project teams on a regular basis. Many of these projects are already live on mainnet, and several have expressed intent to participate in CB DAO as members during the initial cohort. This gives us a direct line of communication with the builder community and allows us to ensure early DAO membership includes high-quality, committed teams aligned with CB DAO's mission and KPIs.\n\nOur team's combination of hands-on DAO implementation, infrastructure development, and builder community engagement positions us uniquely to lead the operational launch and ongoing management of the Cardano Builder DAO.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

CB DAO fills that gap.**\n\nThrough a **transparent governance framework**, **strict accountability mechanisms**, and a **metrics-first funding approach**, CB DAO ensures that builders with growing products on mainnet can scale sustainably, integrate cutting-edge Cardano infrastructure (e.g. Hydra, Leios, Midgard), and contribute to the ecosystem's long-term growth.\n\nThis Treasury Withdrawal is submitted by Intersect on behalf of the vendor.

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nIf implemented, this proposal will directly benefit Cardano dApp developers, the broader ecosystem of users, and ADA holders by creating a reliable funding structure focused on sustained adoption, utility, and on-chain economic activity.\n\nDemonstrated value to the Cardano Community includes:\n\n* **Increased On-Chain Activity**: Providing financial support to launched projects with real users and measurable transactions will grow Cardano's usage metrics, a key indicator of network health and success.\n\n* **Higher TVL and Ecosystem Stickiness**: By supporting projects that retain user assets on-chain, the DAO boosts Cardano's DeFi footprint and TVL.\n\n* **More Reliable Infrastructure & Products**: Developers gain access to capital that enables consistent product development, user support, and innovation.\n\n* **Greater Visibility and Adoption**: Supporting high-impact applications increases Cardano's competitiveness in the broader Web3 landscape, attracting new users and developers.\n\n* **Transparent ROI Tracking**: Funded projects must report KPIs like transaction counts, active users, and commit activity, enabling the community to clearly measure the impact and return on funding decisions.\n\n* **Balance Ecosystem Funding Structure**: This purpose-built funding mechanism complements Project Catalyst by creating a clear delineation between the different development stages of projects, and where they should seek funding within the ecosystem. This enables Project Catalyst to be a more effective innovation engine as larger projects will not rely on Project Catalyst for funding.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team is responsible for building and maintaining Clarity, a governance platform purpose-built for the Cardano ecosystem. Clarity serves as the user-facing interface for interacting with Agora, an open-source, audited library of smart contracts designed for decentralized governance and treasury management.\n\nWe have already deployed this infrastructure in production and actively maintain it. Our smart contracts have governed over $10 million in Total Value Locked (TVL) and are used by four DAOs, each managing six-figure treasuries on-chain. These DAOs use the same tooling and processes that CB DAO will leverage, including member-based voting, proposal submission, temperature checks, and treasury execution fully enforced by smart contracts.\n\nIn addition to our technical capabilities, we work directly with Cardano ecosystem founders and project teams on a regular basis. Many of these projects are already live on mainnet, and several have expressed intent to participate in CB DAO as members during the initial cohort. This gives us a direct line of communication with the builder community and allows us to ensure early DAO membership includes high-quality, committed teams aligned with CB DAO's mission and KPIs.\n\nOur team's combination of hands-on DAO implementation, infrastructure development, and builder community engagement positions us uniquely to lead the operational launch and ongoing management of the Cardano Builder DAO.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

		"motivation": "Funding innovation within blockchain ecosystems presents significant challenges, yet some initiatives shine brightly. Project Catalyst stands out as a prime example, having fueled over 2,100 projects with more than $150 million, a clear testament to Cardano's dedication to decentralized innovation. Still, persistent hurdles across all ecosystems underscore the need for continued refinement in funding approaches.\n\nThe five critical challenges in blockchain ecosystem innovation funding: concentrated voter power, treasury fund limitations, inadequate impact reporting, uncertain ROI, and inefficient milestone management.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe Extended Quadratic Funding model doesn't replace Project Catalyst but complements it, bringing additional funding, greater participation, and enhanced accountability to Cardano's innovation ecosystem.\n\nWe propose a complementary funding mechanism that addresses these challenges through a combination of innovative approaches:\n\n### 1. Democratizing Decision-Making\n\nOur extended quadratic funding model calculates voting power using two factors:\n\n1. **Square root of donation amount** (e.g., $9 donation = 3 votes)\n\n2. **Logarithmic reputation score** (Impact Score) ranging from 300-850\n\nThis approach balances financial contribution with proven community impact, preventing wealth concentration from dominating decisions while maintaining skin-in-the-game principles.\n\nTo protect this system's integrity, we implement:\n\n- **Sybil resistance:** Zero-knowledge proof KYC via Hyperledger Identus (formerly Atala PRISM) ensures one-human-one-account without compromising privacy\n\n- **Anti-collusion measures:**\n\n- Reputation incentives that make system integrity valuable to high-impact participants\n\n- Penalties including reputation loss or platform bans for collusion attempts\n\n- Economic disincentives through fee structures that make vote-splitting unprofitable\n\n- Use [Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding)\n\nFor more information on formal proofs of quadratic voting and literature reviews, see [Kovalchuk et al. 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hq_P_BEvXDhJcph6zmA0_CQHTcO0lyAZ/view?usp=sharing), [Ostrom 2010](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ej30QuyfcyCjNABd6O6S3MEk5Dy14WyL/view?usp=sharing), [Lalley and Weyl 2015](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjZoN4Gcxjwb0Va0OuRgEgBYRVcgDiWI/view?usp=drive_link) and [Poster and Weyl 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_tXBhMIO6WLeVVpv3J_AsicTiSKAUze/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n### 2. Multiplying Treasury Impact\n\nOur model transforms the treasury from sole funder to catalyst:\n\n- Individual donors contribute alongside treasury funds, potentially increasing available capital by 50%+\n\n- U.S. donors benefit from 501(c)(3) tax deductions, creating unique incentives outside the crypto ecosystem\n\n- Donations increase projects' chances of receiving matching funds, aligning individual and ecosystem interests\n\n**Example:** A $1M treasury allocation could attract $500K in individual donations, yielding $1.5M total funding while building broader community investment.

Mohammad is a Cardano community member for the past year.\n\nTo supplement our core team, we maintain a reserve of skilled freelancers, ready to contribute at short notice. Our talent marketplace, Socious, is a hub for over 12,000 individuals, many of whom could potentially assist in this project, if required.\n\nThe trustworthiness in our fund management processes is grounded in our serious adherence to legal and financial compliance. Each transaction conducted is meticulously documented with tangible evidence and audited internally for accuracy. To bolster our commitment to financial transparency, we have established collaborations with external accounting firms that assure compliance. We work with ([Tatsumi Accounting Firm](https://kessan-online.jp/company)) and ([BBCIncorp](https://bbcincorp.com/offshore/accounting-and-auditing)).\n\nAdditionally, we liaise with an external law firm,([Enlighten Law Group](https://www.enlightenlaw.com/)), to ensure full legal compliance. This meticulous, multilayered approach to fund management reflects our dedication to maintaining high levels of trust and accountability.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe Extended Quadratic Funding model doesn't replace Project Catalyst but complements it, bringing additional funding, greater participation, and enhanced accountability to Cardano's innovation ecosystem.\n\nWe propose a complementary funding mechanism that addresses these challenges through a combination of innovative approaches:\n\n### 1. Democratizing Decision-Making\n\nOur extended quadratic funding model calculates voting power using two factors:\n\n1. **Square root of donation amount** (e.g., $9 donation = 3 votes)\n\n2. **Logarithmic reputation score** (Impact Score) ranging from 300-850\n\nThis approach balances financial contribution with proven community impact, preventing wealth concentration from dominating decisions while maintaining skin-in-the-game principles.\n\nTo protect this system's integrity, we implement:\n\n- **Sybil resistance:** Zero-knowledge proof KYC via Hyperledger Identus (formerly Atala PRISM) ensures one-human-one-account without compromising privacy\n\n- **Anti-collusion measures:**\n\n- Reputation incentives that make system integrity valuable to high-impact participants\n\n- Penalties including reputation loss or platform bans for collusion attempts\n\n- Economic disincentives through fee structures that make vote-splitting unprofitable\n\n- Use [Connection-Oriented Cluster Matching](https://www.gitcoin.co/blog/leveling-the-field-how-connection-oriented-cluster-matching-strengthens-quadratic-funding)\n\nFor more information on formal proofs of quadratic voting and literature reviews, see [Kovalchuk et al. 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hq_P_BEvXDhJcph6zmA0_CQHTcO0lyAZ/view?usp=sharing), [Ostrom 2010](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ej30QuyfcyCjNABd6O6S3MEk5Dy14WyL/view?usp=sharing), [Lalley and Weyl 2015](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EjZoN4Gcxjwb0Va0OuRgEgBYRVcgDiWI/view?usp=drive_link) and [Poster and Weyl 2019](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E_tXBhMIO6WLeVVpv3J_AsicTiSKAUze/view?usp=drive_link)\n\n### 2. Multiplying Treasury Impact\n\nOur model transforms the treasury from sole funder to catalyst:\n\n- Individual donors contribute alongside treasury funds, potentially increasing available capital by 50%+\n\n- U.S. donors benefit from 501(c)(3) tax deductions, creating unique incentives outside the crypto ecosystem\n\n- Donations increase projects' chances of receiving matching funds, aligning individual and ecosystem interests\n\n**Example:** A $1M treasury allocation could attract $500K in individual donations, yielding $1.5M total funding while building broader community investment. Please see more details in the \"Why this amount\" section below.\n\n### 3. Standardized Impact Reporting\n\nAll funded projects must:\n\n- Contract with designated impact accountants (funded from project allocation)\n\n- Report standardized metrics including:\n\n- On-chain transactions generated\n\n- New wallets created\n\n- Active users acquired\n\n- Other ecosystem growth indicators\n\nThis creates the first comprehensive dataset of innovation ROI within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\n### 4. Sustainable Value Capture\n\nWe establish a voluntary contribution system where funded projects share value with the ecosystem through:\n\n- Equity stakes\n\n- Token allocations\n\n- Revenue sharing agreements\n\n- Carbon credits or other generated assets\n\nOur target is a 5% annual return within 10 years---an ambitious but achievable goal based on startup ecosystem standards.\n\nThe most reliable measure of VC fund returns comes from the Cambridge Associates US Venture Capital Index, which shows an 8.5% annual return over 10 years as of December 31, 2023. While this net return to limited partners reflects the overall pooled performance, typical median returns are lower, around 4-5%, due to the skewed distribution of returns.\n\nSources:\n\n- [Cambridge Associates US PE/VC Benchmark Commentary Calendar Year 2023](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/insight/us-pe-vc-benchmark-commentary-calendar-year-2023/)\n\n- [Seraf-Investor.com Dividing the Pie: How Venture Fund Economics Work Part II](http://seraf-investor.com)\n\n- [Emmanuel Maggiori Venture Capital Returns: True Lies?](https://emaggiori.com/venture-capital-returns/)\n\n- [Founder Equity Fund The New Reality of Venture Capital](https://founderequity.com/the-new-reality-of-venture-capital)\n\n- [British Business Bank UK Venture Capital Financial Returns 2024](https://www.british-business-bank.co.uk/about/research-and-publications/uk-venture-capital-financial-returns-2024)\n\n- [EY Q2 2023 Venture Capital Investment Trends](https://www.ey.com/en_us/insights/growth/q2-2023-venture-capital-investment-trends)\n\n- [Jumpstart Magazine How Long Until a VC Makes Returns?](https://www.jumpstartmag.com/how-long-until-a-vc-makes-returns/)\n\n- [Cambridge Associates WEB-2020-Q2-USVC-Benchmark-Book](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/WEB-2020-Q2-USVC-Benchmark-Book.pdf)\n\n### 5.

Our talent marketplace, Socious, is a hub for over 12,000 individuals, many of whom could potentially assist in this project, if required.\n\nThe trustworthiness in our fund management processes is grounded in our serious adherence to legal and financial compliance. Each transaction conducted is meticulously documented with tangible evidence and audited internally for accuracy. To bolster our commitment to financial transparency, we have established collaborations with external accounting firms that assure compliance. We work with ([Tatsumi Accounting Firm](https://kessan-online.jp/company)) and ([BBCIncorp](https://bbcincorp.com/offshore/accounting-and-auditing)).\n\nAdditionally, we liaise with an external law firm,([Enlighten Law Group](https://www.enlightenlaw.com/)), to ensure full legal compliance. This meticulous, multilayered approach to fund management reflects our dedication to maintaining high levels of trust and accountability.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

An indicative quote from one top-tier exchange would be around 1m USD of token allocation.\n\n- Not more than 500k USD (1m ADA) will be allocated for 1 CNT / Exchange.\n\n- Flowdesk acts as an actor of good faith to validate the budget allocated to a Cardano project for a listing.\n\n- Flowdesk does NOT receive any funds from the Intersect budget during this process (including no transaction fee, commission fee, etc.).\n\n- Flow for a Cardano project to request funds to get listed on an exchange:\n\n=> 1 Cardano project with a CNT\n\n=> Project agrees with the exchange on a listing offer\n\n=> Flowdesk Exchange Listing Criteria Assessment\n\n=> Decision\n\n=> If successful, exchange directly receives funding from Intersect for listing the CNT\n\n=> CNT is listed on the exchange.\n\n2- Market Making Fee Pool:\n\nEligible tokens are:\n\n-Non stable coins: SNEK, IAG, MIN and HOSKY\n\n-Stable coins: USDM, USDA, iUSD, DJED, KINKA (gold backed)\n\nBudget: 63,000 USD (126,000 ADA at a reference price of 0.5 USD / ADA).\n\nNotes:\n\n- Intersect > Cardano Project > pays Flowdesk monthly retainer for MMAAS business.\n\n- Flowdesk does NOT receive any funds from the Intersect budget during this process (including no transaction fee, commission, etc.).\n\n- Flow for a Cardano project to request funds for MMAAS with Flowdesk:\n\n=> Cardano projects\n\n=> Project agrees with Flowdesk on a MMAAS offering\n\n=> Cardano project receives funding from Intersect\n\n=> Flowdesk launches the MMAAS service.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nPartnerships already signed with major partners in the Cardano ecosystem:\n\n- [Nov 14th 2024 Snek MMAAS](https://x.com/CardanoFeed/status/1857081807109243353)\n\n- [Dec 9th 2024 Iagon MMAAS](https://x.com/IagonOfficial/status/1866147717564539258)\n\n- [Dec 14th 2024 DexHunter partnership](https://x.com/DexHunterIO/status/1867923226468233595)\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"motivation": "1. Lack of Wallet & Custodian Support for Cardano Native Assets:\n\nMajor institutional custodians (e.g BitGo, Fireblocks) do not natively support Cardano native assets, including USDA. This creates a bottleneck for exchanges, OTC desks and institutions who rely on these custodians for secure asset storage. Without custodian integration:\n\n-Exchanges cannot list Cardano-native assets, limiting liquidity and trading opportunities\n\n-Institutional investors face custody risks, reducing their willingness to engage with Cardano Ecosystem\n\n-Cardano projects struggle to attract capital, as investors prefer assets with established custody solutions\n\nImpact:The absence of institutional-grade custody solutions stifles liquidity, restricts market access and slows Cardano's growth.\n\n2. Limited Availability of Cardano Native Assets on Exchanges & OTC Desks:\n\nDespite Cardano's $700M+ DeFi ecosystem, its native assets---including stablecoins---are severely underrepresented on centralized exchanges (CEXs) and OTC desks.\n\n-Few trading pairs for Cardano assets (eg. ADA/USDA, USDA/USDT)\n\n-No derivatives markets (futures, options) for Cardano stablecoins, limiting trading volumes\n\n-OTC desks avoid Cardano-native assets due to limited institutional LPs\n\nImpact: Without deep exchange liquidity, traders and institutions cannot efficiently enter or exit positions\n\n3. Lack of Real-World Stablecoin Utility Beyond Crypto Trading:\n\nStablecoins mainly serve crypto trading, with USDC gaining enterprise use---while Cardano's stablecoins remain underutilized across real-world sectors:\n\n-Cross-border B2B payments ($31.6 trillion market)\n\n-Remittances ($850 billion market and where low fees matter)\n\n-Payroll & merchant settlements\n\nCardano's low fee structure makes it ideal for payments, but the lack of integration with traditional finance, prevents adoption.\n\nImpact: Without real-world use cases, Cardano's stablecoins are limited to DeFi\n\n4. Restricted Fiat On/Off-Ramp, Especially in Frontier Markets:\n\nUsers in emerging markets (Africa, LATAM, Asia) struggle to convert ADA and Cardano-native assets into local fiat due to:\n\n-High fees (5-7% for card-based ramps vs. ~1% for local bank transfers\n\n-Limited payout network & banking access\n\nImpact: Limited DeFi participation and slow retail adoption due to costly on/off ramps.\n\nEthereum & Ripple are expanding stablecoin adoption. Without custody solutions, Cardano misses institutional demand. Stablecoins will reshape global finance, and frontier markets need blockchain.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\na. Wallet Support for Cardano Native Assets: USDA is pursuing strategic partnerships with firms like Zoida Markets, and in talks with BitGo, Zodia Custody, CipherBC, etc. Our goal is to enhance Cardano Native Assets by improving reach, reliability, and pricing through collaboration with key custodians, and wallet infrastructure providers---ultimately boosting distribution, liquidity and user adoption.\n\nb. Availability of USDA / Native Assets on Exchanges, OTC Desks and NEO Banks: Anzens is focused on bringing USDA to CEXs, NEO banks, OTC desks, and other key distributors to expand its reach. By enabling USDA pairs for Cardano tokens on exchanges, we aim to boost usability, drive adoption through spot listings, and support broader participation via derivatives trading. Enabling USDA with NEO banks would offer USDA <> Fiat pairs in exotic currencies\n\nc. Drive USDA adoption to unlock real-world utility: Anzens would be initiating cross integration with real estate developers, remittance companies and other payment companies to bring USDA as part of their backend settlement network, helping Cardano gain adoption beyond the crypto space.\n\nd. Access to Fiat on and off-ramps: Encryptus has piloted ADA-to-fiat off-ramps for Yoroi Wallet users, enabling users to convert ADA to local currencies across 70+ countries---including India, China, Philippines, Nigeria etc---via bank transfers, without relying on SWIFT or card networks. Encryptus aims to build stronger on-ramps with local payment rails.\n\nThe funds from this proposal would be utilized to:\n\n1. Develop Onramp Capabilities: Current ADA onramps via cards are costly and don't support Cardano Native Assets. Encryptus aims to solve this by offering low-cost onramps through local bank transfers and mobile wallets---cutting costs by up to 60%. This will ease access to ADA and native assets. Ideal for Cardano DeFi and wider eco-system. Phase 1 of the services would include countries in LATAM, Africa and parts of Asia with a Phase 2 expansion to developed economies.\n\n2. Cardano's deterministic fee structure makes it well-suited for payment use cases. However, integration with traditional payment systems has been a challenge. Encryptus is addressing this by developing alternative payment solutions---such as global bill payments, school fees, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) products---on the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives showcase Cardano's practical value to Web2 users, helping to broaden its adoption and real-world relevance.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team brings together seasoned professionals with deep expertise in payments, stablecoins, and cryptocurrency infrastructure, backed by 50 years of combined experience at leading firms such as Paxos, Huobi (HTX), OKX, Western Union, Citi Bank, and BitPesa (AZA Finance). We have played pivotal roles in advancing fintech innovation, blockchain payments, and digital asset ecosystems, equipping us with unmatched insights into global payment networks, compliance, and scalable financial solutions.\n\nMultidisciplinary Leadership\n\nOur team includes former CEOs, legal counsels, product leads, and senior strategists with expertise across technology, compliance, and business development.\n\nKey strengths include:\n\n- Crypto & Stablecoins: Hands-on experience in liquidity management, institutional adoption, and blockchain-based payments.\n\n- Building global remittance networks that facilitate seamless cross-border transactions in the frontier and emerging markets\n\n- Technology & Product: Proven track record in building secure, compliant financial infrastructure for payments and digital assets.\n\n- Scaling crypto exchanges and developing liquidity solutions to support institutional and retail trading.\n\n- Regulatory & Compliance: Direct experience navigating global financial regulations for stablecoins and cross-border transactions.\n\n- Business Growth: Successfully expanded operations and partnerships across North America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\na. Wallet Support for Cardano Native Assets: USDA is pursuing strategic partnerships with firms like Zoida Markets, and in talks with BitGo, Zodia Custody, CipherBC, etc. Our goal is to enhance Cardano Native Assets by improving reach, reliability, and pricing through collaboration with key custodians, and wallet infrastructure providers---ultimately boosting distribution, liquidity and user adoption.\n\nb. Availability of USDA / Native Assets on Exchanges, OTC Desks and NEO Banks: Anzens is focused on bringing USDA to CEXs, NEO banks, OTC desks, and other key distributors to expand its reach. By enabling USDA pairs for Cardano tokens on exchanges, we aim to boost usability, drive adoption through spot listings, and support broader participation via derivatives trading. Enabling USDA with NEO banks would offer USDA <> Fiat pairs in exotic currencies\n\nc. Drive USDA adoption to unlock real-world utility: Anzens would be initiating cross integration with real estate developers, remittance companies and other payment companies to bring USDA as part of their backend settlement network, helping Cardano gain adoption beyond the crypto space.\n\nd. Access to Fiat on and off-ramps: Encryptus has piloted ADA-to-fiat off-ramps for Yoroi Wallet users, enabling users to convert ADA to local currencies across 70+ countries---including India, China, Philippines, Nigeria etc---via bank transfers, without relying on SWIFT or card networks. Encryptus aims to build stronger on-ramps with local payment rails.\n\nThe funds from this proposal would be utilized to:\n\n1. Develop Onramp Capabilities: Current ADA onramps via cards are costly and don't support Cardano Native Assets. Encryptus aims to solve this by offering low-cost onramps through local bank transfers and mobile wallets---cutting costs by up to 60%. This will ease access to ADA and native assets. Ideal for Cardano DeFi and wider eco-system. Phase 1 of the services would include countries in LATAM, Africa and parts of Asia with a Phase 2 expansion to developed economies.\n\n2. Cardano's deterministic fee structure makes it well-suited for payment use cases. However, integration with traditional payment systems has been a challenge. Encryptus is addressing this by developing alternative payment solutions---such as global bill payments, school fees, and Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) products---on the Cardano blockchain. These initiatives showcase Cardano's practical value to Web2 users, helping to broaden its adoption and real-world relevance.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nOur team brings together seasoned professionals with deep expertise in payments, stablecoins, and cryptocurrency infrastructure, backed by 50 years of combined experience at leading firms such as Paxos, Huobi (HTX), OKX, Western Union, Citi Bank, and BitPesa (AZA Finance). We have played pivotal roles in advancing fintech innovation, blockchain payments, and digital asset ecosystems, equipping us with unmatched insights into global payment networks, compliance, and scalable financial solutions.\n\nMultidisciplinary Leadership\n\nOur team includes former CEOs, legal counsels, product leads, and senior strategists with expertise across technology, compliance, and business development.\n\nKey strengths include:\n\n- Crypto & Stablecoins: Hands-on experience in liquidity management, institutional adoption, and blockchain-based payments.\n\n- Building global remittance networks that facilitate seamless cross-border transactions in the frontier and emerging markets\n\n- Technology & Product: Proven track record in building secure, compliant financial infrastructure for payments and digital assets.\n\n- Scaling crypto exchanges and developing liquidity solutions to support institutional and retail trading.\n\n- Regulatory & Compliance: Direct experience navigating global financial regulations for stablecoins and cross-border transactions.\n\n- Business Growth: Successfully expanded operations and partnerships across North America, Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSince 2017, IOR has published over 200 research papers, demonstrating its commitment to advancing blockchain science for the benefit of Cardano.\n\nEach year, IOR aims to generate a pipeline of at least 20 high-impact research initiatives for the Cardano ecosystem at SRL2*, supported by peer-reviewed research papers and technical reports. From this funnel, 6 of these initiatives will be validated and prioritized for implementation at SRL4/5*, reinforcing Cardano's leadership in blockchain R&D.\n\n* **Fundamental Research**\n\nResearch outputs vary in complexity and significance, with the average paper taking at least two years to complete due to the rigorous academic peer-review process.\n\nAs research conferences grow increasingly competitive, underscoring the need for excellence and relevance, we remain committed to delivering at least 20 high-quality publications and technical artefacts each year.\n\nTo maximize visibility and impact, we are strengthening dissemination efforts across academic and Cardano-specific channels to boost citations, engagement, and impact.\n\n* **Technology Validation**\n\nTechnology Validation will validate 6 research initiatives annually, including technical reports, formal specifications, prototypes, simulations, Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs), and Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Prototypes and technical documentation. Please note, workstreams starting in the second half of the year will be delivered the following year.\n\nTechnical reports provide in-depth analysis and implementation guidance, while prototypes demonstrate real-world application for product teams within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nCPSs and CIPs play a key role in driving transparency, collaboration, and community-driven enhancements.\n\nSoftware Readiness Levels (SRLs) outline the lifecycle of a technology, from basic principles to commercial readiness, using an internationally accepted scale of 1-9.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIOR is the leading blockchain academic group in the worldwide research community. Currently, the Input Output Research library contains over 200 peer-reviewed, published papers, involving more than 150 academics.\n\nAround 50 of these papers are core to Cardano's five development phases, providing the foundational research and innovation that has helped shape Cardano into its current form.

Critical infrastructure must also undergo rigorous research and validation, as flaws can compromise network security or endanger user assets. By focusing on high-potential R&D areas, this initiative builds a strong foundation for innovation, accelerates time to market, and drives meaningful economic and societal outcomes.",

				"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nSince 2017, IOR has published over 200 research papers, demonstrating its commitment to advancing blockchain science for the benefit of Cardano.\n\nEach year, IOR aims to generate a pipeline of at least 20 high-impact research initiatives for the Cardano ecosystem at SRL2*, supported by peer-reviewed research papers and technical reports. From this funnel, 6 of these initiatives will be validated and prioritized for implementation at SRL4/5*, reinforcing Cardano's leadership in blockchain R&D.\n\n* **Fundamental Research**\n\nResearch outputs vary in complexity and significance, with the average paper taking at least two years to complete due to the rigorous academic peer-review process.\n\nAs research conferences grow increasingly competitive, underscoring the need for excellence and relevance, we remain committed to delivering at least 20 high-quality publications and technical artefacts each year.\n\nTo maximize visibility and impact, we are strengthening dissemination efforts across academic and Cardano-specific channels to boost citations, engagement, and impact.\n\n* **Technology Validation**\n\nTechnology Validation will validate 6 research initiatives annually, including technical reports, formal specifications, prototypes, simulations, Cardano Problem Statements (CPSs), and Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). Prototypes and technical documentation. Please note, workstreams starting in the second half of the year will be delivered the following year.\n\nTechnical reports provide in-depth analysis and implementation guidance, while prototypes demonstrate real-world application for product teams within the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nCPSs and CIPs play a key role in driving transparency, collaboration, and community-driven enhancements.\n\nSoftware Readiness Levels (SRLs) outline the lifecycle of a technology, from basic principles to commercial readiness, using an internationally accepted scale of 1-9.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIOR is the leading blockchain academic group in the worldwide research community. Currently, the Input Output Research library contains over 200 peer-reviewed, published papers, involving more than 150 academics.\n\nAround 50 of these papers are core to Cardano's five development phases, providing the foundational research and innovation that has helped shape Cardano into its current form. Input Output Global has also contributed to more than 40 CIPs and 6 CPSs.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nWe propose OpShin, a Python-based smart contract language for Cardano. Python is one of the most popular programming languages known. On top of this we provide the security guarantees that are the reason for the Cardano community to embrace functional programming - thus offering an accessible and easy to start with alternative to current languages.\n\nOpShin is aimed at developers that want to build on Cardano. It drastically simplifies onboarding when experience in Python is given, and even without is easy to read and access.\n\nBy making development of Smart Contracts more accessible, OpShin is a key catalyst for a growing ecosystem of DApps on Cardano. The benefit to the community is immense.\n\nThe project is under ongoing development. The language itself is already completed and production ready, but the Smart Contract Ecosystem is always evolving (i.e. new Plutus versions, standards, CIPs). This evolution requires continuous adaptations. The proposal is enough to fund further development for one year. There are no fixed deliverables as it is hard to predict the changes in the ecosystem.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe main proposer, Niels, has already bootstrapped the main part of the project. In its current form the tool is able to be used and already being used. The proposer is completely doxed and well-known in the Community.\n\nHe also has a strong network of competent and experienced developers interested and capable in supporting the project.\n\nHe is supported on a per-demand basis by contributors to OpShin such as Julius Frost and S.C. Musson, who have redeemed themselves by contributing valuable improvements.\n\nThe main goal of this proposal is to improve usability and developer experience with respect to Smart Contracts on Cardano. With the given funds, the continued development of the toolchain is secured as developers can be hired to tackle basic issues in the toolchain whereas the main proposer is able to allocate more time of the day towards developing OpShin himself.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect.

The proposer is completely doxed and well-known in the Community.\n\nHe also has a strong network of competent and experienced developers interested and capable in supporting the project.\n\nHe is supported on a per-demand basis by contributors to OpShin such as Julius Frost and S.C. Musson, who have redeemed themselves by contributing valuable improvements.\n\nThe main goal of this proposal is to improve usability and developer experience with respect to Smart Contracts on Cardano. With the given funds, the continued development of the toolchain is secured as developers can be hired to tackle basic issues in the toolchain whereas the main proposer is able to allocate more time of the day towards developing OpShin himself.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledgebase.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account. All instances of TRSC and PSSC can not be staked with a SPO and will be delegated to the auto-abstain predefined DRep. From here funds will be withdrawn into a UTxO remaining at the TRSC.\n\nWhen the Legal contract is prepared and the vendor is ready, funding for this project will be transferred using the Fund action to a PSSC. All milestones will be outlined within the metadata.\n\nA dashboard will be available for the community to audit the TRSC or PSSC and track metrics related to this withdrawn ada as well as being immutably verifiable on chain.\n\nThe subsections; Contract Management, Project Delivery, and Budget Management Tooling described above cover the constitutional requirements specified in Article IV section 4 and 5.",

		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nThe outcome of this proposal is a 2030 community-driven vision for Cardano, a 2026 proposed roadmap, and the first consolidated product research effort in Cardano. This will be achieved by providing clear paths for the broader Cardano community to participate in the 2030 vision creation process---both by contributing insights as key stakeholders and by enabling the collection of additional input through structured user and customer interviews, along with targeted product research initiatives.\n\nKey Outcomes and value this proposal will deliver:\n\n- Broad community participation in the first community-driven Cardano vision creation process\n\n- Documented insights from the community shared brain\n\n- Documented insights from key groups (such as SPOs, builders, and businesses in and outside of Cardano and Blockchain)\n\n- Participation in creating and critiquing the first draft proposal for a 2030 Cardano vision\n\n- Creation of the first framework and consolidated data set of insights coming from product research guiding Cardano (and builders on Cardano) on what are the most prominent user needs and the key market opportunities\n\n- Opportunities to access funding to run product research initiatives\n\n- Identify promising focus areas for Cardano to achieve product-market-fit, which can be coordinated with the Technical Steering Committee of Intersect to ultimately identify mission-critical Cardano feature sets\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nIntersect is a non-profit member-based organization incorporated in Wyoming, USA. The team at Intersect represents a broad mix of experience and domain expertise, spanning open source, governance, infrastructure, fintech, and decentralized systems. Many of our team members are long-standing contributors to Cardano and are deeply embedded in the ecosystem - both professionally and as community participants.\n\nThe Cardano Product Committee of Intersect is made of members' elected product experts with knowledge in business, market research, and user research. The committee is also supported by academic researchers and it will consult Subject Matter Experts to define research initiatives and allocate funds in an open and transparent process to expert providers, as well as to properly document and share all the collected insights.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution. Intersect will administer the contract on behalf of its members and in alignment with governance actions approved by DReps. This includes coordinating project delivery schedules, reporting progress transparently to our members and the community, and escalating any disputes to the Governing Board and membership for resolution in accordance with established procedures.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the Constitution.

Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control. The administration of both TRSC and PSSCs will be managed by Intersect, with external oversight on certain actions from the Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Oversight Committee consists of Sundae Labs, Cardano Foundation, Dquadrant, Xerberus and NMKR. Their role is to independently verify key administrative actions using on-chain logic, ensuring accuracy and consistency without exercising discretion over governance decisions.\n\nFor all details on Intersect's configuration please see the **[Smart Contract Guide](https://docs.intersectmbo.org/cardano-facilitation-services/cardano-budget/intersect-administration-services/smart-contracts-as-part-of-our-administration)** on the knowledge base.\n\nThe high level permissions are as follows:\n\n- TRSC Fund and PSSC Modify\n\n  - Two of the three Intersect admins, two of the five trusted entities and one of the two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Disperse\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, three of five trusted entities and two of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Pause and Resume\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Sweep\n\n  - One of three Intersect admins, and one of two Intersect leadership sign-off must authorize\n\n- TRSC Reorganize\n\n  - Two of three Intersect admins and three of five trusted entities must authorize\n\n#### Processes\n\nUpon enactment of this governance action, funding for this project will be directed into the TRSC's stake account.

The goal is to allow smart contracts on Cardano to verify cryptographic proofs over customizable curves and fields. This will include:\n\n- Plutarch support for Galois field arithmetic\n\n- Plutarch support for elliptic curve arithmetic\n\n- A generic ZK verifier in Plutarch\n\n- A validation test suite over BLS12-381\n\n- A composable YTxP-compatible Plutarch wrapper\n\nThis tool empowers developers with on-chain cryptographic flexibility, expands Cardano's ZK application capabilities, and sets the stage for future innovations in privacy and authentication.\n\nDeliver a parameterized elliptic curve and finite field cryptography framework in Plutarch, enabling developers to build smart contracts that verify zero-knowledge proofs over arbitrary curves.

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nCardano currently lacks reusable and composable on-chain cryptographic tooling for elliptic curves and finite fields. Developers building ZK or privacy-preserving applications must either hardcode specific cryptographic primitives (limiting generality) or implement complex curve logic themselves (introducing security risks and inefficiencies). There is no widely accepted, verifiable standard for parameterized zero-knowledge verification on Cardano.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\nMLabs will create a two-part proof-of-concept system, named Grumpelstilskin, designed to allow application developers to easily use any curve of their choice for zero-knowledge proof verification on-chain. The first part of Grumpelstilskin will be a 'working script' which, when given appropriate parameters via its datum, will verify a zero-knowledge proof over a user-specified curve. This script will be tested for correctness.\n\nThe second part of Grumpelstiltskin will be a YTxP-based interface to the 'working script', implemented in Plutarch. This interface will be well-documented, easy to use, and flexible, with a focus of making life easy for application developers who want to use zero-knowledge proofs. Thanks to their use of YTxP, future performance, security and functionality improvements will not be the responsibility of application developers who use Grumpelstilskin. This second part will be distributed as an open-source project.\n\nMLabs aims to build a minimum viable product, with the future goals of expanded functionality, improved performance, as well as a full audit of the 'working script'. The choice of YTxP will make it minimally difficult to achieve this,and will impose minimal friction on any application developers using Grumpelstiltskin to build their products.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nMLabs has extensive experience in cryptography, Plutarch smart contracts, and zero-knowledge systems. Our past work includes Plutarch, the Cardano Transaction Library, and zkApp R&D. We are contributors to multiple community standards and tooling projects (e.g., CTL, Ply, Cardano.nix).\n\nAlso we have done work towards bitwise operators previously in CIP-123 which is related to this work and can possibly be used towards its implementation.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract.

Ongoing Maintenance:\n\n- Ensure compatibility with new Cardano network upgrades.\n\n- Address bug fixes, performance improvements, and security issues.\n\n2. Feature Enhancements:\n\n- Implement new features based on community feedback.\n\n- Optimize the codebase to improve performance and scalability.\n\n3.

		"motivation": "This proposal aims to solve the following problem:\n\nBloxBean has developed a suite of open-source Java tools essential for Cardano developers, including the Cardano Client Lib (CCL), Yaci, Yaci Store, and Yaci DevKit. These tools enable Java developers to interact seamlessly with the Cardano blockchain.\n\nTools like Yaci DevKit are also used by non-Java teams to quickly set up a local Cardano devnet for testing purposes.\n\nAs the Cardano ecosystem evolves, it is crucial to keep these tools up-to-date with the latest network changes, optimize their performance, and provide robust documentation and feature enhancements to ensure continued effectiveness.\n\nWhile BloxBean projects are supported by a small team of contributors, with the lead maintainer (Satya) being an employee of the Cardano Foundation, the growing demands for ongoing improvements require additional resources.\n\nThis proposal seeks funding to hire one additional full-time developer through BloxBean to support the maintenance and enhancement efforts for the next 12 months.\n\nBloxBean Tools Overview\n\n----------------------\n\n**Cardano Client Lib (CCL):** A powerful off-chain Java SDK designed for Java/Scala/Kotlin developers to build and submit all types of transactions to the Cardano Blockchain. Used by many Java and Scala developers in the community.\n\n**Yaci:**\n\nA Java library implementing the Cardano mini-protocol. It allows any Java/Scala/Kotlin application to interact directly with the Cardano blockchain to retrieve real-time blockchain data.\n\n**Yaci Store:**\n\nA modular Java library designed for developers building custom indexing solutions. It also provides out-of-the-box indexers and includes a reward calculation component. It is used in key projects like the Rosetta Java exchange tool.\n\n**Yaci DevKit:**\n\nA comprehensive developer toolkit enabling faster iteration with a custom local Cardano network that can be easily created and destroyed. Used by both Java and non-Java projects.",
		"rationale": "### Project Solution\n\n- Long-Term Support: Ensure BloxBean tools remain compatible with future Cardano upgrades for a seamless developer experience.\n\n- Enhanced Developer Efficiency: Improve tools and documentation, making it easier for developers to build on Cardano using Java and other JVM languages.\n\n- Ecosystem Growth: Support the continued adoption and integration of BloxBean tools by Java developers, benefiting the overall Cardano ecosystem.\n\n- Open-Source: Maintain these tools as open-source projects, encouraging collaboration and contributions from the global developer community.\n\n### Vendor Profile\n\nThe BloxBean team has extensive experience in developing and maintaining Cardano-related tools for Java developers. We have been maintaining these tools since 2021 and have been active in the Cardano ecosystem for several years, ensuring the tools remain up to date and functional for the community.\n\n### Contract Management\n\nA written off-chain Legal Contract will be created between the Vendor and the Cardano Development Holdings (CDH), as mandated by the constitution, and will be administered by Intersect. This will include details of the project delivery schedule and dispute resolution.\n\n### Project Delivery \n\nAll milestones, acceptance criteria, payment amounts and expected delivery dates will be agreed between the Vendor and Intersect, acting on behalf of the CDH. The vendor will deliver according to the agreed-upon project schedule within the Legal Contract, of which the necessary information will be made public via the budget management platform via transaction metadata.\n\nDefined by the milestones within a Legal Contract, the vendor will submit and attest milestone acceptance to the community, Intersect or 3rd Party Assurer.\n\nProject progress will be monitored via Intersect's delivery assurance function which will be communicated to the community.\n\nAcceptance of the above work is expected to be supported by a 3rd Party Assurer, who will be responsible for reviewing and signing off the work completed at each project milestone against the corresponding milestone deliverables detailed within the Legal Contract. This work is funded from a portion of this treasury withdrawal.\n\n### Budget Management Tooling\n\nTo administrate treasury funds on-chain, Intersect will utilize the treasury management smart contract framework developed by Sundae Labs. The smart contracts have been [extensively tested](https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/treasury-contracts/tree/main/offchain/tests) including audits from TxPipe and MLabs. Examples of the usage of these contracts can be seen across mainnet described across Intersect authored [Blog 1](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-a-step-toward-on-chain-treasury-withdrawals), [Blog 2](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-two-update) and [Blog 3](https://www.intersectmbo.org/news/smart-contract-mainnet-demo-day-three-update).\n\nFinal mainnet validation test can be seen via the Disburse action within transaction: 0f591dc544ae14102dbb4a74d5311a6acffc1772b163d8b7a9656b9525950b17\n\nWith the confirmed treasury reserve contract address being: stake17xzc8pt7fgf0lc0x7eq6z7z6puhsxmzktna7dluahrj6g6ghh5qjr\n\n#### Specifics\n\nIntersect will utilize a single Treasury Reserve Smart Contract (TRSC), with many Project-Specific Smart Contracts (PSSC), managed by Intersect. Intersect's management consists of three 'admin' and two Intersect 'leadership' roles. An Oversight Committee consisting of five external, independent third-party entities will provide checks and balances on Intersect, and safeguard against errors and unilateral control.
